Armor comes in many forms, such as exotic plate-mail, nuclear-powered exoskeletons, or mechanically-created force fields. The player should work with the Judge to create proper Armor for their hero. The player can also determine which Powers are possessed by the hero and which are properties of the armor. Powers built into the armor can later be modified and enhanced; think of the changes Tony Stark has made in the Iron Man armor. On the other hand, Powers that are built into the armor may suffer mechanical failure. The Armors Power rank determines its ability to resist damage. The player also has to determine where they got the Armor in the first place. This is covered in the "Character Creation" section elsewhere in this book. If the hero gained the armor through an accident, they might not be able to repair it. Powers D2 through D9 have ranges listed on column B of the Range Table.' },

It provides protection against a variety of forces, including brute force, energy attacks, and extreme temperature conditions. It can be projected and used for a variety of Power stunts. The following seven force fields protect against specific forms of attack. Each protects the hero and the surrounding area. The maximum size of the force field is the number of areas equal to 10% of the Power\'s rank number. For example, a Monstrous Force Field can protect 8 areas. The force field completely absorbs any attack which has an Intensity equal to or less than the Power\'s rank number. If the Intensity is higher, it is reduced by the Power\'s rank number. The remaining Intensity breaches the force field and affects anyone within by this diminished effect. These forms cannot be used for many of the Power stunts suggested for force fields as given in the Player\'s Book. These cannot be used to physically attack or to handle solid materials. However, the hero can develop Power stunts which reflect each form\'s special nature. The hero can form shields to protect distant targets at +2CS range. By expanding his field outward, the hero can sweep his surroundings clean of anything affected by his force field. The Power can be used as a filter to sort out anything affected by his force field. The force field can be formed around something it would affect, thus trapping it. The hero can move the "trap" at will up to +2CS by means of a red FEAT.' },

The Power absorbs the energy of the attack up to this rank and redirects it. A Typical FEAT sends the attack off in a random direction. A Fantastic FEAT reflects some of the attack back onto the attacker; it is now -3CS in Intensity. An Unearthly FEAT sends the entire attack back onto the attacker. If the attack\'s Intensity is higher than this Power\'s rank, some of the damage passes through and affects the hero. The Power rank is subtracted from the attack\'s Intensity. While most of the attack is reflected, the remainder gets through to the hero. Example: The terrible Turnabout is battling X-Factor. Cyclops fires an optic blast of Remarkable Intensity. Turnabout possesses Excellent Reflection. His Power splits the blast in two. A Feeble blast penetrates his Power and knocks Turnabout back. The bulk of the blast was reflected. Turnabout made an Amazing FEAT, so some of Cyclops\' blast returns to him. Cyke takes Typical damage from his own Power. Normally, this Power is consciously controlled and only appears when the hero wills it. However, the Power can be turned against the hero by such means as Power Control/Magnification and Power Domination. In such cases, the Power can be magnified beyond the hero\'s control to a level where it reflects everything, including air, food, and water. The Power can be used indefinitely, so long as it isn\'s overcome by superior force. After the first time the Power is breached, the hero must make a green FEAT. Failure to do so means his Power has failed. After the second breach, the hero must make a yellow FEAT. For each breach following that, he must make a red FEAT. This applies to a continual use of the Power. If his Power fails, the hero cannot regain it until 24 hours have passed. Resistances have no ranges.' },

The hero gains a number of Health points equal to his Power rank number each time he is hit by his specific form of absorbable energy. This addition to Health quickly heals any damage the hero had suffered, and acts as a buffer to absorb consequent damage. In the absence of life-sustaining materials, this Power can act as a substitute for air, water, and food. The hero converts energy into healing power for the damage he\'s taking from suffocation, dehydration, starvation, and any other unpleasant results of not living carefully. Unfortunately, this requires a steady supply of energy to convert. Consider Galactus. He is perpetually starving. He uses this Power to absorb the energy of life-forces and convert it into his own life force. Yet, draining ten billion life-forces only sustains him for a single year, at most. Your hero wont\'s last anywhere near as long. There is the danger that your hero may actively seek out energies he can absorb and heal himself with. The danger occurs if the energy type is a dangerous one that does great damage wherever it occurs. For example, consider a character whose Absorption Power affects hard radiation. In the absence of other superbeings who possess Radiation Powers, the character might resort to breaking into reactors or even purposefully detonating nuclear bombs to get the energy he needs.

The hero begins with the ability to transform any energy into one specific form. He can develop the ability to transform energy into other forms as Power stunts. There are two advantages to this Power. The first is the ability to gain an Energy Emission Power fueled by the environment. Dazzler, for example, can convert sonic energy into light. She then refined that Light Generation into a variety of effects, including lasers, light shields, and hypnotic effects. The second advantage is the ability to transform deadly force into less dangerous forms. For example, if your hero found himself caught in a raging firestorm, he might convert the heat into Cold. This would both protect him and extinguish the fire. (The paramedic shook his head. \"I\'ll be danged if I can figure out how a man can get frostbite fighting a fire.\") The maximum Intensity of Energy that a hero can convert is equal to one rank higher than his Power rank (a red FEAT). Excess energy remains in its original state, although its Intensity is diminished by the Power\'s rank number. Example: The Astounding Adaptor possesses Excellent Energy Conversion. While traveling through Nebraska, he spots a tornado about to touch down. He directs his Power at the tornado, which possesses Amazing Intensity. The most his Power can directly affect is Remarkable Intensity. He tries for a red FEAT and succeeds. The tornado bursts into an Amazing Intensity flash of orange light. High winds of Remarkable Intensity continue to buffet the area, but at least the worst of the property damage has been avoided. ("Now if I could just get these spots out of my eyes…") When creating the character, the player can raise his Power by +1CS by limiting him to a specific Energy Conversion (Sonics to Light, in Dazzler\'s example).

   { DieRoll: '37-38', Category: 'Energy Vampirism', Description: 'she hero can drain the energy from a target and convert that energy into extra Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and other Powers he possesses. The hero can force a non-living, nor sentient target to release all its energy, an Intensity FEAT equal to the energy potential of the target. For example, an auto battery can be drained on a Typical Intensity FEAT, a gallon of gasoline by Good Intensity FEAT, the magnetism every tape in a music shop on an Living and/or sentient targets are harder to drain, because they possess Psyche. The target\'s Psyche determines the Intensity of the FEAT needed. A successful FEAT enables the hero to drain energy from the target. The amount drained is equal to this Power\'s rank number. The amount is drawn from all the target\'s Energy Emission Powers and any energies that form his physical make-up; this applies if the hero is a non-human (a robot, for example). The Energy Vampire can only drain Powers that actually emit energy—see the Energy Emission section. Powers that do not emit energy cannot be affected by this Power (but, see Power Vampirism). The Energy Vampire can drain the Power rank number amount of energy each turn as long as he keeps making successful FEATs. He can voluntarily stop feeding at any point by making a Psyche FEAT roll of any color except red. A red FEAT means his hunger is beyond his control. He has entered a feeding frenzy that will only cease when the target has been completely drain of energy. If the Energy Vampire fails to make any FEAT during the feeding process, he breaks off his attack and cannot reestablish it. The victim instantly develops an immunity to that particular Energy Vampire, and cannot be subjected to any of his future attacks. However, this does not protect the victim from other Energy Vampires. The drained energy is added in equal amounts to the Vampire\'s Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and any other Powers he possesses. The exception is this Power; no Vampire of any type can increase his own Power. Example: Evan the Energy Vampire possesses Good Energy Vampirism. His intended victim is Heatwave, a human with two Powers (Typical Gliding and Excellent Heat Emission) and Good Psyche. Evan makes the required FEAT roll (not red) to begin feeding, and drains 10 points from his victim\'s highest Power rank number. Heatwave\'s Heat Emission loses 10 points and drops to Good. Evan\'s three abilities go up 3 points each, thus increasing his Health by 6. The next turn, Evan makes another FEAT and drains another 10 points, drawn equally from Heatwave\'s Psyche and Heat Emission (dropping each by 5 points). Add another 3 points to Evan\'s three abilities and another 6 to his Health. The next FEAT is a repeat performance. At this point, Evan\'s player decides he\'s had enough, and rolls a 43; quitting is no problem. Why do Energy Vampires do it? Due to their odd nature, they lose energy at a dreadful rate. Their rank numbers for Strength, Endurance, and Psyche, and all Powers (except this one), drop 1 point per hour. The Energy Vampire must feed to bring those abilities and Powers up to their original levels. An Energy Vampire cannot actually starve to death; when all his affected rank numbers reach Shift 0, he enters a deathlike trance. His Vampirism continues to function and tries to drain anything that comes in contact with him. When the Vampire\'s abilities return to Feeble, he returns to life. When creating the Energy Vampire, the player must choose a weakness. He can increase the Power rank by +1CS by choosing a second weakness, up to a maximum of +3CS (four weaknesses) for the Energy Vampire. Energy Vampirism is communicable. A living and/or sentient victim who was Completely drained of all energy by an Energy Vampire must make a mandatory Psyche FEAT roll. On a red result, he becomes an Energy Vampire with Feeble Power rank Excellent intensity FEAT, the heat of a blast furnace on an Amazing Intensity FEAT and so on.' },

He can alter any factor involved in combustion without direct physical contact. The hero can increase or decrease the flame\'s Intensity up to his Power rank and reduce fire damage by his rank number. This Power includes Power rank Resistance to Fire and Heat. The most important aspect of this Power is enabling the hero to reshape flame into any form he desires. This can be used in a variety of Power stunts, as the hero develops numerous fiery constructs to perform miscellaneous deeds. Such fiery constructs do not act like normal flames. They emit less heat and consume less oxygen. Their fire doesnt\'s spread past the outline of the constructs. In addition, they self-extinguish rapidly upon cessation of this Power. Optional Powers include Fire Generation, Thermal Control, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body.' },

Gravity always exists wherever there is tangible matter. (in dimensions composed entirely of energy, though, gravity is optional.) The hero doesnt\'s really generate gravity; he simply changes the Intensity of what\'s already there. He can increase or decrease the Intensity of gravity by his Power rank number. This effect may be centered on himself or projected onto a target. This permit him to develop a variety of Power stunts: • Changing the direction of gravity. • Creating artificial gravity in a normally weightless situation. • Launching targets into space by reducing their weight to zero and letting the Earth\'s revolution fling them upward. • Levitation at -1CS speed; this can be done to the hero himself or a target. • Incapacitating a foe by suddenly, drastically increasing his weight beyond his Strength\'s capacity to move. • Forcing aircraft to land by increasing their weight beyond their engines\' lift potential. • Sinking ships by making their weight exceed their buoyancy. • Forming large asteroids by coalescing spacial debris. The gravity remains altered for as long as the Power functions. After cessation, gravity returns to normal.' },

The hero can increase or decrease the radiation\'s Intensity, up to his Power rank, and reduce the damage done by radiation up to his Power rank number. The hero can direct the flow of radiation and can alter its nature by converting any form of radiation to any other form. If a radiation-related Power is involved, the target\'s Power rank determines the Intensity of the required FEAT. For example, an Amazing Intensity FEAT is required to control Amazing Radiation Emission. Optional Powers include Hard Radiation Emission, Energy Doppelganger, Energy Sheath, Energy Body, and Energy Sustenance.' },
   { DieRoll: '54-59', Category: 'Kinetic Control', Description: 'she hero can control the energy of motion itself. He can increase or decrease kinetic energy\'s Intensity by his Power rank number. With a Typical Intensity FEAT, he can change the direction of any moving target. He can impart momentum as if he physically pushed the target, with his Power rank taken as Strength. The primary purpose of Kinetic Control is to control Telekinesis and Kinetic Bolts. In the former case, the hero can redirect the target\'s efforts. A FEAT equal to the target\'s Power rank taken as Intensity ensures this. In the latter case, the hero can shape Kinetic Bolts into forms that can perform complex tasks. The difficulty of such tasks determines the Intensity of the required FEAT. The hero can have a Bonus Power of either Telekinesis or Kinetic Bolt. The remaining Power can be an Optional one.' },

The hero can alter the intensity, frequency (color, in other words), and coherence of light on a Good Intensity FEAT. The hero can actually change the direction of light and form crude holograms on a Remarkable Intensity FEAT. Such holograms are little more than clouds or single-color walls. The Power allows +1CS Resistance to Light-based Powers, since the hero can redirect or dispel them. Optional Powers include Light Generation, Energy Sheath, Carrier Wave, and Illusion Casting. The Nemesis is itself.' },

The hero can increase or decrease the plasma\'s Intensity and reduce its damage by his Power rank number. The Power includes Power rank Resistance to plasma\'s effects. The Power has two main uses. The first is shaping plasma fields into any shape desired. This can be developed into a variety of Power stunts as the hero develops numerous plasma-constructs to perform various deeds. Such constructs do possess the typical side effects of plasma fields, and dissipate upon cessation of the Power. The second use of Plasma Control enables the hero to counteract plasma-related Powers. These include Plasma Generation, Energy Doppelganger, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body. The target\'s Power rank determines the required intensity of the FEAT. For example, an Excellent Intensity FEAT is required to control Excellent Plasma Generation. Optional Powers include Plasma Generation, Energy Doppelganger, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body.' },

The hero can shift the location and size of shadows, form them into two-dimensional images that can do Power rank damage to real targets, and Remote Sense through these shadow constructs. The hero can increase or decrease the Intensity of any shadow, whether natural or Power-based, by their Power rank number. This overlaps with Light Generation and Shadowcasting but only affects existing shadows or shadow-related Powers. The hero can see through any shadow as if it were a normally-lit area, provided its Intensity is equal to or less than their Power rank. This does not apply to Darkforce. This Power includes Power rank Resistance to shadow-based Powers and has the Bonus Power of Shadowcasting. Optional Powers include Light Control, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body, in which case the hero resembles a living shadow.' },

This Power also grants Resistance to sound-based Powers, reducing the attack\'s Intensity by their Power rank number. It is a highly versatile Power with many uses, such as muting opponents\' voices, silencing alarms, magnifying distant sounds, amplifying faint noises to perform tasks like cracking a combination lock, and even adjusting the volume of music. It can also reinforce sound-based Powers, raising their rank by +1CS as long as this Power functions. This Power includes the Bonus Power of Sound Generation and has optional Powers like Vibration and Vibration Control.' },

This Power overlaps with Heat and Cold Generation but differs in that it cannot affect the natural temperature of a target or alter the local temperature at will. For example, Thermal Control could cool a girder being heated in a furnace but not a girder lying outside the furnace. Thermal Control is mainly used to counteract or supplement other temperature-altering Powers, affecting them as soon as they are emitted. The target\'s Power rank determines the required Intensity of the FEAT. Optional Powers include Heat Generation, Fire Generation, Cold Generation, Fire Control, and Coldshaping.' },

He can increase or decrease the vibration\'s Intensity by his Power rank number and has Power rank Resistance to Vibration and Sonic attacks. The hero can use this Power to control earthquakes by matching the vibration\'s Intensity to the Richter scale (e.g., a Typical Intensity FEAT for a class 2 earthquake). It can also be used in various situations such as distorting or muting a target\'s voice, disabling gyroscopes in vehicles, adjusting the vibratory rate of atoms to phase through solid objects, or allowing bullets to pass harmlessly through him. Optional Powers include Vibration, Sonic Generation, and Sound Manipulation.' }

The temperature cannot drop lower than absolute zero. The Power also cools the air between the hero and target, causing gases to condense, which quickly evaporate once the Power ceases. Cold Generation can negate other sources of cold but cannot raise the temperature in frigid environments. The hero has Power rank level resistance to Cold. Optional Powers include Coldshaping, Condensation, Solidification, and Molding. Nemeses include Heat Emission, Fire Generation, and Thermal Control.' },

The hero can limit range to contact only, gaining +2CS damage by conducting through solid conductors. Electricity forms include static (causing magnetic attraction and disrupting communications), lightning (destructive power), alternating current (energizing or overloading devices), and direct current (energizing or shorting devices). The hero can choose any form or specialize for +1CS. The Power includes Power rank Resistance to Electricity, with no FEAT needed to resist their own Power. Extreme heat reduces rank by the heat’s Intensity, while cold increases rank. At Shift X level, the hero can create a stream of conductive gas to function in a vacuum.' },

The player decides which Powers the Doppelganger possesses, typically assigning physical Powers to it. The Doppelganger can either be an extension of the hero\'s will or have an independent mind, with +1CS for independence and another +1CS if the hero falls unconscious when using the Power. Damage to the Doppelganger is subtracted from the hero\'s Psyche. Rank determines the duration and minimum rank of the Doppelganger’s Powers, and at high ranks, the hero can generate multiple Doppelgangers (1% of Power rank number). The Doppelganger has -2CS Resistance to plasma-based attacks and +4CS Resistance to Light, Heat, Flame, Vibrations, and Sonics. The Nemesis Power is Plasma Control.' },

This permits the hero to do rank level effects over target materials. Some Power Stunts using pure heat include: Causing the breakdown of molecular or even atomic bonds (Amazing and Unearthly FEATs, respectively). Negating a target\'s magnetism. Negating a target\'s electrical conductivity. Strengthening materials by heat-treating. Changing local weather by heating the air; this can cause small cyclones and electrical storms. Because this Power uses pure heat, it can function in conditions that negate Flame Emission, like the absence of free Oxygen or the hero\'s being underwater. Beings who possess Thermal Vision or Abnormal Sensitivity can detect an infrared glow around the hero and his target whenever he uses his Power. Heat Emission is the Nemesis of Cold Emission, Coldshaping, and Powers that use water. This Power gains +1CS when attacking those Powers and loses -1CS when being attacked by them.' },

The field can affect anything susceptible to magnetism, attracting it with Power rank Strength. If the target itself is magnetic, the hero can attract it at +1CS or repel it at Power rank. The hero can induce magnetism into any materials that can sustain a magnetic field; these include ferrous materials, iron-bearing clays and plastics, and ferrous ores. The hero can do rank level damage to electronic devices by scrambling internal signals; this is especially effective against magnetic recordings and micro-chip dependent devices. This Power can affect other Powers. It can redirect Electrical Generation by a Typical Intensity FEAT if the other Power\'s rank is lower, a Remarkable Intensity FEAT if equal, and an Unearthly Intensity FEAT if the other Power is higher. It can disrupt Electric or Magnetic Control and Energy Sheath or Energy Body, if either are magnetic in nature. The Power has its drawbacks. It attracts some types of attacks if the hero is careless.

Reason and Psyche plummet to Feeble rank while the ranks for Strength and Fighting increase by the same number of ranks. (That is, the total number of points lost are split evenly between the Fighting and Strength ranks.) The hero also develops Iron Will for the duration of the Berserker rage; the rank for this is the same as the Berserker Power\'s rank. The Berserker lasts for the length of combat and 10 turns. When the rage ends, all the altered Abilities return to their original ranks. Since the Iron Will also disappears, the hero finally feels the effects of any damage he suffered while in the Berserker rage. Example: Orlando the Furious has Feeble Strength, Good Fighting, Remarkable Reason, Incredible Psyche, and Excellent Berserker Power. When he enters the Berserker rage, the following occurs: Psyche and Reason drop to Feeble, a total of 66 points. This is split between Orlando\'s Strength and Fighting ranks. Strength increases to Remarkable, Fighting to Incredible. Finally, he develops Excellent Iron Will. The carnage that ensues is short and messy. Orlando emerges victorious but remains rather dangerous to be around for another 10 turns (5 minutes). The Optional Power is Natural Weaponry.

However, this Power increases a hero\'s already-mastered Martial Arts (a Talent in the game system) to dramatically higher levels and allows him to perform actions that would otherwise be impossible, like splitting a battleship in two with a single karate chop. Martial Arts as explained in the Advanced Set falls into five categories labeled A through E for simplicity\'s sake: • A-This form uses the opponent\'s Strength against him and permits the hero to Stun or Slam an opponent regardless of their relative Strengths and Endurances. • B-This form is keyed to offense by inflicting damage by short, quick bursts. The hero gains +1CS Fighting when engaged in unarmed combat. • C-This form concentrates on holds and escapes. The hero gains +1CS to his Strength when Grappling or Grabbing and +1CS to his Agility when dodging. • D-This form seeks out the opponent\'s weak points and strikes at them. The hero can ignore the effects of physical Armor when determining Stun and Slam results. Unfortunately, the hero must study his opponent for two turns before he can bring this effect into play. • E-This form encourages quick striking to catch an opponent off-guard. The hero gains +1 to initiative rolls when engaged in unarmed combat. The player chooses one of the above Martial Arts and determines its rank when he creates the hero. When this Power shows up, add its Power rank number to the already determined Talent rank number. For example, the Kung Fu Kommando possesses Martial Arts E at Typical rank and Martial Arts Supremacy at Good rank. These combine to give Kung Fu Kommando an Excellent rank for his Martial Arts. Martial Arts Supremacy can be used to do rank-level damage against non-living matter. For example, Kung Fu Kommando can shatter iron, concrete, or bullet-proof glass with a red Power rank FEAT. If desired, this Power can be modified to fit any Fighting skill the player can imagine. This can include Supremacy in any one weapon, such as swordsmanship or archery. Optional Powers include Iron Will and Weapons Creation. The Nemesis Power is Martial Arts Supremacy of one rank higher than that possessed by the hero.' },
    { DieRoll: '61-75', Category: 'Natural Weaponry', Description: 'she hero\'s body contains special anatomical features that can function as weapons. These may be of any nature and can be external, internal, or retractable. If these are damaged the hero suffers as if they were normal body parts. When creating the hero, the player decides the nature of the weaponry. The weaponry chosen possesses this Power and rank taken as material strength for purposes of determining potential damage. Each time the player rolls this Power, he can add another weapon to the hero. As stated in the Player\'s Book, some forms of Natural Weaponry provide Bonus Powers (see "Claws" and "Extra Body Parts"). These are placed in the next available slot in the Power Generation. The player and the Judge need to work together to create a functional hero. A drawback to this Power is that if the hero is somehow deprived of his Natural Weaponry, he suffers a loss to his Fighting Ability equal to his weapon\'s rank. Example: Due to a mishap with a matter transmitter, Wolverine temporarily loses his claws. He\'s so shaken that his normal Incredible Fighting Ability drops to Feeble. If the Natural Weaponry is made of materials not normally found in the body, it makes the hero vulnerable to attacks that affect those materials. For instance, Wolvie has a -1CS resistance to Magneto\'s powers, since they can affect his metal skeleton.' },
    { DieRoll: '76-80', Category: 'Weapons Creation', Description: 'she hero can create any desired weapon out of thin air. The weapon can be of any design, size, and material. The size of the weapon is limited by its weight. The hero can only create in a single turn a maximum number of ounces equal to his Power rank number. Heavier weapons have to be assembled in pieces over a span of several turns. While the material strength of the created weapon is the same as that of a normally-manufactured weapon of the same type, its duration is much shorter. The hero must have detailed knowledge of any weapon he wants to create. He can only store a limited number of weapons\' designs in his memory. The total number of memory slots available to this Power equals the hero\'s Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of the weapons he can create. This list can be changed at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains the hero a new design. If no open memory slots are available, an old design is tossed away to make room for the new one. Normally, the Power is used to make facsimiles of existing weapons. The hero must make a detailed study of the weapon for at least 10 minutes before attempting a FEAT. Failure to make the FEAT means the hero must spend another 10 minutes studying the weapon before attempting another FEAT. Some weapons might be beyond the hero\'s comprehension, if the player has really bad luck when rolling the dice. The hero can create new weapons based solely on his imagination and basic knowledge of weapons design. This requires intense concentration and a red Power rank FEAT. The newly created weapon has the same characteristics as a normally created one of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary weapons, the player and Judge should agree on a reasonable and playable set of characteristics for the weapon in question. The Power includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. Each element or compound takes up its own memory slot, just like the throwing daggers and broadswords that clutter the hero\'s mind. Such raw matter can be formed into any weapon\'s shape. This permits the hero to change the composition of any already-memorized designs. For example, if he has already memorized the design of an arrow and the nature of silver he can create both wood and steel arrows and silver arrows. Weapons created materialize in the hero\'s hands. There is an exception to the rules thus far. When creating the hero, the player can choose to specialize in creating a single copy of a special weapon. In this case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per Health point to one pound per Health point. Such special weapons are never permanent; Unearthly Intensity FEATs are treated the same as Amazing Intensity ones. One example of this option is Magik\'s Soulsword. The Optional Power for this is a form of Martial Arts Supremacy that uses a special weapon, as in the option explained above. The Nemesis Power is True Invulnerability. Determined at the time of creation. A Typical Intensity FEAT gives the weapon a lifespan of 100 turns times the hero\'s Reason rank number. On an Amazing Intensity FEAT, the weapon lasts for the hero\'s Reason rank number times 10,000 turns. Should he make an Unearthly Intensity FEAT, the weapon will be permanent. Each ounce of created matter temporarily costs the hero 1 Health point. All points lost in this manner are regained after 24 hours. Thus, the hero can only create a weapon weighing the number of ounces equal to his Health score in a single day.' },
    { DieRoll: '81-100', Category: 'Weapons Tinkering', Description: 'she hero can devise and assemble any weapon that can be made with the available materials. By means of a red FEAT, the hero can even improvise a means of creating unavailable materials (adamantium, for example). Provided he has the resources, the hero can assemble a functional copy of any weapon. As to what weapons he can make, use the Resource costs listed in the Hardware section of the Player\'s Book (pages 42-46). Compare the Power\'s rank with the cost of the desired weapon. Equal or lower cost weapons can be created on a green FEAT. A cost of one to three levels higher requires a yellow FEAT. A cost of four to six levels higher requires a red FEAT. If the cost of the desired weapon is more than six levels higher than the heros Power rank, it is an impossible FEAT. Example: Dr. Fixit has Excellent Weapons Tinkering and access to his brother-in-law\'s junkyard. He wants to build a battle-copter with adamantium armor. The copter has an Amazing cost. True adamantium has a Shift X cost; secondary adamantium has an Unearthly cost. Dr. Fixit makes the yellow FEAT; his copter will work. He doesnt\'s have any adamantium, though, and tries to improvise. He fails to make a red FEAT; neither batch of \"home-brewed\" adamantium worked. Oh well, he can always convert that old boiler he found into armor plate. When creating the hero, the player can choose to make the character a jack-of-all-trades or specialist in a particular field. If he chooses to specialize, he can raise the rank +2CS. Categories of weapons include: Edged and Blunt weapons, Projectile weapons, Energy weapons, Heavy weapons, Battle weapons, Alien weapons, Battlesuits, War robots. Needless to say, the player will have to develop stats for anything he comes up with. If he successfully copies existing technology, like the Iron Man battlesuit or a SHIELD Plasma Beam Handgun, he can simply use the established stats for that device. Weapons Locker (MHAC8) by Epperson and Grubb is a valuable aid to the player of a hero with this Power. A clever character can also use this Power to make money off of other characters by building weapons on commission. After all, somebody\'s got to be building all those super-weapons that fill the pages of comic books…' }

    { DieRoll: '01-15', Category: 'Animate Image', Description: 'Ranges for the Powers in this book are found on the Range Table printed on the inside front cover. The normal range for the Powers in this section are found on column B. I1/Animate Image: This is a specialized form of Illusion-casting that enables the hero to apparently bring any flat image to life. Whatever the original nature of the image—drawing, painting, photograph, print—the image gains three dimensionality and independent movement. A blank white area now fills the area formerly occupied by the newly solidified Image. In actuality, the hero has created two Illusions. The obvious one is the Animated Image that has peeled itself away from its flat background and filled out into three dimensions. The second, more subtle Illusion is the "blank white area." The hero automatically casts this Illusion to mask out the still-existing original picture; this secondary Illusion lasts for 10-20 turns or until the primary Illusion ceases to exist, whichever comes first. The initial range at which the hero can Animate an Image is line-of-sight for one area. This is also the maximum range at which the hero can normally maintain the "realism" of the Image. Simply put, the hero has to be able to clearly see both the Image and its surroundings. When either is beyond his vision, the believability of the Image drops drastically. When the Image gets beyond the hero\'s field of clear vision, he can no longer make it realistically conform to the surroundings. Example: Kinescope Animates a lion off of a circus poster and sends it after some muggers. The muggers flee around a corner, the lion in pursuit. Unbeknownst to Kinescope, the alley is full of trash cans, which the lion blithely passes through. The muggers see this and realize they\'ve been had. Kinescope gets a surprise when he comes around the corner. The Image can exist for as long as the hero concentrates on maintaining it (the Judge is free to determine how easily this can be done given the circumstances the hero finds himself in). Although the Image can only be realistically controlled within one area of the hero\'s location, the Image can be projected up to the full range for this Power. Once beyond the one area limit, the Image is easily perceived by others as a holographic projection. The hero can overcome this limit by extending the range of his own senses, either through artificial means (telescopes, remote TV camera, etcetera) or by using sense extending Powers. In such cases, the hero can extend realistic control of the Image up to the range limits for this Power and whatever means he employs to extend his vision. Example: Kinescope has an Excellent rank for this Power and can project an Image up to 25 areas (3300 feet) away. He also has Good Clairvoyance with a maximum range of 2500 miles. By using both Powers, he can maintain the realism of his Images up to the maximum range of 25 areas even through any vision-blocking barriers. The Image possesses whatever abilities or characteristics the original model possessed. At least, it possesses those abilities or characteristics the hero believes the model possessed. This is after all an Illusion that the hero has created. As such, it conforms to his expectations. What traits the Image has are determined by the hero\'s imagination and memory for detail. The accuracy of the Image is determined by the hero\'s Reason. A green FEAT creates an Image that is somehow flawed; it might move the wrong way, lack a shadow, have no surface detail, and so on. A yellow FEAT creates an Image that are nearly exact; a close visual examination is required to distinguish the Image from reality. A red FEAT creates a perfect Illusion. The typical Animated Image is an intangible holographic projection. Since most people rely exclusively on their vision as the means of sensing their environment, the Animated Image is easily accepted as reality. Only when other senses are used does the Image get exposed as Illusion. Such Images are mechanically detectable and recordable by such means as photography and television. Images can also deceive the artificial senses of mechanical beings. The Animated Image is initially strictly composed of light. It lacks the other sensory details of a real object, most notably the sounds and smells of the original. These can be simulated to give the Animated Image greater reality. The Talent of Ventriloquism or such Powers as Speechthrowing or Vocal Control can add speech and incidental noises to the image. Sensory Manipulation can create, deceptions of smell, temperature difference, and even tactile sensations. The coherent light of the Image blocks normal light and creates normal shadows. Since the Image is intangible, it cannot directly do physical damage to a target. If the Image incorporates bright light, it has the potential of blinding the target. However, if the hero possesses certain other Powers that can be combined with the Image then it can do actual damage. If the hero also uses Energy Solidification or any of the Matter Creation Powers, the Image gains temporary solidity. This lasts for 1 -10 turns, regardless of the normal duration of effect for the supplementing Power. Note: this is determined by the Judge, not the player. Any of the Energy Emission Powers can be apparently redirected through the Image. For example, if the hero possessed both Animate Image and Fire Generation, he could create a hazardous simulation of the Human Torch. This Power can be combined with certain Psionic Powers to create Images that do psychosomatic damage to a target. These Psionics, include Telepathy, Mental Domination, Hypnotic Control, and Neural Manipulation. Psychosomatic damage occurs because the target believes in the reality of the Image and thus the. -reality of any damage the Image is inflicting upon him. For example, Kinescope combines his Powers of Animate Image and Neural Manipulation to create an Image of a boa constrictor. The boa enwraps Kinescope\'s opponent, who believes he is being crushed and passes out from his imagined loss of breath. Psychosomatic damage can be resisted by any target who becomes aware of the Image\'s lack of reality. Be warned that psychosomatic damage can lead to fatal results if the target succumbs to a heart attack or stroke. Note also that psychosomatic damage cannot affect non-sentient minds. Ani' },
    { DieRoll: '16-70', Category: 'Illusion-Casting', Description: 'she hero can create realistic holographic images that have apparent solidity. These Illusions can be mechanically detected and recorded by such means as photography or television. That separates this Power from the psionic, image-generating Power called Hallucinations, which produces images directly in the target\'s mind and cannot affect mechanical senses. The Illusion can take any size or appearance the hero desires and is limited only by his imagination. The Illusion can be a realistic simulation, a fanciful creation direct from the hero\'s mind, or an abstract display of light. The hero is playing with light itself and can create anything that is visible. Since most people depend. on vision to gain information on their surroundings, this Power presents the awesome ability to apparently alter the nature of reality. The hero can cast his Illusions anywhere within his Power rank range, though he must be able to clearly see the area where the Illusion is forming if he wants to make it at all realistic. The normal limit for unaided vision is one area (132 feet). Beyond that range the hero can no longer clearly see his Illusion\'s surroundings and thus cannot alter the Illusion to reflect things going on around the Illusion. For example, an Illusionary tree cast two areas away might seem to be floating a discreet two inches above the ground. If the hero is unconcerned about maintaining the reality of his Illusions, this limit can be ignored. The hero does not even need to be able to see the Illusion as it forms. Such uncontrolled Illusions appear as transparent, free floating apparitions. If the Illusion takes the form of a living being, viewers might see it as a ghost or other phantom form. If the hero possesses a means of extending the range of his senses, he can maintain the realism m of his Illusion at up to full range of both this Power and that of whatever means he uses to extend his vision. Ways of increasing the senses range include mechanical means such as binoculars and remote TV cameras and sense-extending Powers, most notably Telescopic Vision and Clairvoyance. Example: Deetee has an Incredible rank and can Illusion-Cast up to two miles away. She also has a good pair of binoculars that enable her to see up to one mile away. For idle amusement, she likes to go to the top of tall buildings and Cast Illusions at the pedestrians below. She also like to find the monitors for remote surveillance cameras and use them to direct her Illusions into locked rooms. Illusions last as long as the hero concentrates on maintaining their existence. The Judge is free to determine how long the hero can maintain his concentration in a given circumstance. Breaking the hero\'s concentration abruptly terminates the Illusion, while merely getting distracted causes the Illusion to begin to lose realism (drift, lose detail, become translucent, and so on). The Illusion\'s effect on a viewer varies. A viewer must make an Intuition FEAT against the Power rank of the Illusion-caster; success means the viewer now recognizes the Illusion\'s true nature. Players running characters viewing an Illusion are only allowed to make a FEAT if they suspect the Illusion. This can occur if they physically touch the Illusion, if the Illusion is somehow flawed, or if the character is just naturally cynical. ("Congratulations, Les. So far this morning you have attempted to disbelieve the existence of a flying saucer, Galactus, two muggers, and your breakfast."). Since Illusion-Casting includes the Power of Light Control, Illusions can provide a measure of protection against light-based attacks. An Illusory tent would provide protection against both infrared and ultraviolet light, thus keeping the hero cool and safe from sunburn. Treat this Power as +2CS Resistance to Light-based attacks. It does not provide protection against any of the other ways Moms Nature has of affecting us. That Illusory tent would be drafty, cold, and flimsy. Illusion Casting can be combined with other Powers to give 1he Illusion enhanced realism; this can also create Illusions that do real physical damage. If the Illusion-caster has any of the Energy Emission Powers, these can be redirected to apparently originate from the Illusion rather than from the hero. For example, combining this Power with Plasma Generation would simulate the Phoenix-force and fry any electronics in the area. More commonly, the power is used to disguise the true nature of anything the hero or her companions might be doing. Example: Deetee and her buddy Jayboy have to break into a certain building that they know is under surveillance. Deetee doesn\'s care about subtlety, only About distraction, and casts an Illusion of a,.Large elephant that comes lumbering around a corner and lies down in front of the door. Inside the elephantine Illusion, Jayboy is free to use his Kinetic Bolt Power to smash open the door. He also uses his K-bolts to simulate the effect the elephant\'s legs have when they kick against a target. The main drawback to Illusion-Casting is that the hero must keep his Power\'s true nature a secret from his adversaries. It must be presented as if it were another Power entirely. For example, although she is an Illusion-caster, Deetee often presents herself as a Demon-Summoner. Even if the Power\'s nature is public knowledge, the Power is still effective. The Powers of Light Emission and Light Control are innate factors of Illusion Casting. As such, the hero has the ability to generate any intensity and frequency of light. He can warp light, alter its frequency, and change its degree of coherency. The hero can do -2CS rank level damage using light-based attacks. ' },

    { DieRoll: '86-100', Category: 'Illusory Duplication', Description: 'she hero can create a finite number of exact holographic duplicates of himself. These are Illusions based on his selfimage, which the hero had best make sure matches his actual appearance at that moment. The accuracy of the Duplicate is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Duplicate is generated. A green Reason FEAT means the Illusory Duplicates are somehow different from the hero; they have the wrong outfit on, are too muscular or handsome, and so on. A yellow or red Reason FEAT produces a perfect copy. The maximum number of simultaneous Duplicates the hero can create is equal to his Power rank number. Although Duplicates are frequently used to surround the hero and act as decoys, the Duplicates can also function several areas or miles away from the hero. The maximum range at which the hero can either send or create a Duplicate is determined by his Power rank; specific levels are shown on column B. Example: Myriad has an Incredible rank. This enables him to create up to 40 simultaneously existing Duplicates that can form or travel as far as two miles away from his location. The Duplicates are intangible holographs and are incapable of doing any actual physical activity. They are primarily used as decoys, messengers, spies, and simulated ghosts. The Duplicates can form in any location within the hero\'s range, regardless of whether the hero can see that location or not. As an aspect of this Power, the hero automatically possesses a combination of Clairvoyance, Clairaudience, and Speechthrowing that permits him to see, hear, and speak through his remote Duplicates. For example, Myriad is at the scene of a cave-in. The rescue crew need to know where any survivors are located. Myriad creates several Duplicates and sends them off into the debris. Since these are energy, the Duplicates can pass effortlessly through the rock. Myriad sees what the Duplicates "see." There is no light in the collapsed area but Myriad\'s Duplicates each carry an illusion of a flashlight that functions as well, if not better, than a real one. Finally two of the Duplicates find survivors. The first group of survivors are only lost; the Duplicate leads them through the darkness to safety. The second group is trapped behind fallen rock. They are startled when the Duplicate passes through the rock into their area but Myriad speaks through his Duplicate and appraises them of the situation. The Duplicate remains with them until the rescuers finally reach them. When creating the hero, the player has the option of assigning some or all of the hero\'s other Powers to the Duplicates. The hero can only create a single such Powerful Duplicate at any one time. Since this Duplicate now has a greater effect on reality, it gains some reality as well. Such Duplicates can be affected and even destroyed by such attacks as Light and a red FEAT. The player blows it on the first roll (a 23), second roll (03), third roll (24), but finally makes it on the fourth roll (00). Myriad castigates himself on the additional 24 seconds it took him to Emission, Light Generation, Plasma Generation, Plasma Control, Shadowcasting, and any of the Magics and Power Controls. The Duplicate has a "Health" equal to this Power\'s rank number. Any damage to the Duplicate is subtracted from this number. At zero the Duplicate suddenly vanishes. In addition, any damage done to the Duplicate is also suffered by the hero, who temporarily loses a number of points equal to his Power rank number. Such points are regained just like Health points. All Duplicates can be affected by the Powers of Light Control and Shadowcasting. Light Control can overpower, distort, and even destroy any Duplicate. It can be use to seize control of a Duplicate away from the hero; the effect is analogous to someone using Mind Control/ Puppetry on the hero\'s own body. Shadowcasting can surround the Duplicate in darkness and prevent the hero\'s Clairvoyance from operating. If the Shadowcasting has a greater rank, that Power can be used to destroy a Duplicate. Note: when a Duplicate is passing through solids, its "eyes" register total darkness. If the hero is unaware that Shadowcasting is being used against his Duplicates, then he will assume the continued darkness is the result of the Duplicate remaining within a solid mass and consequently will make no attempt to resist this clandestine attack. As stated earlier, all Duplicates are an illusionary manifestation of the hero\'s self-image. They need not be a single, static design but can change with the hero\'s whim. Generally, all Duplicates at a given moment will have the same shape. However, by means of a red Reason FEAT, the hero can create simultaneous Duplicates who have different appearances. All such differences are still based on the hero\'s own form. A red FEAT is needed for each different type of Duplicate. Example: Myriad maintains a secret identity as a physicist at a nuclear plant in Georgia. One day the plant is attacked by supervillains. Myriad must take action but his civilian identity must remain at his emergency post. Myriad forms a number of Duplicates. Most resemble his super heroic self but Myriad alters one to appear as his civilian self. The extra form requires additional concentration on Myriad\'s part generate the lab coat and glasses. While Duplicates are normally created as independent beings, the Power can also be cast around the hero\'s own body to immediately alter the hero\'s own appearance. This is usually used to make quick disguises and costume changes. If the hero so chooses, his entire super hero appearance and costume can be nothing more than such a Illusion wrapped around the hero\'s normal civilian self. This would definitely prevent anyone from finding your costume stashed in the back of the closet. In the previous example, Myriad had not thought to bring his costume to work and had to form one of his Duplicates around himself. The drawback is that if the hero loses concentration, consciousness, or Power, he also loses his costume. (The time Myriad was skinnydipping when a crisis struck resulted in major embarrassment for him and some unfortunate media exposure.) Nemesis Powers include Light Control and Shadowcasting.' }

Healing cures damage, wounds, toxins, and diseases, with varying FEATs for different severities. Regeneration allows for the regrowth of lost limbs and organs. Revival brings the dead back to life, with a FEAT depending on the state of the corpse. Damage Transferral lets the hero heal another by taking on their damage, which the hero later heals through Self-Healing. Decay accelerates the collapse of body tissue, causing rapid deterioration. Disruption upsets physiological functioning, causing health losses. Aging accelerates or reverses the aging process, with a FEAT determining the extent.

To initiate an attack, the Bio-Vampire must make a Power FEAT, with the victim\'s Psyche determining the difficulty. Each successful FEAT drains Health points equal to the Power rank number, which is converted into energy to increase Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and any other Powers except for Bio-Vampirism. Feeding requires a continuous FEAT; the Bio-Vampire can stop feeding with a successful Psyche FEAT roll. A red FEAT indicates the Bio-Vampire has entered a feeding frenzy.

The hero can transform the entire body or specific parts as stated beforehand. The target loses sensation in the affected areas, but the safeguards ensure the lifeforce remains intact. Transformations are categorized into three forms: Chemical (changing the target\'s chemical makeup), Physiological (altering life functions, turning the target into animal, plant, or a different chemical form), and Energy (converting the target into a coherent energy field). The player chooses or specializes in one form. If the Power is generated randomly, the player can select another form or add +1CS to the chosen form.

No chemical can counteract the paralysis while the Power is in effect. • Seizure: The target\'s muscles spasm uncontrollably for as long as the Power is in effect. • Exaggeration: Nerve signals are actually amplified, causing the target to overact when attempting any movement. Normally, a hero can select any of these effects. When creating the hero, the player can choose to specialize in one effect for a benefit of +2CS. Note: This Power only affects the voluntary muscles; it does not affect the autonomic nervous system which controls the heart, lungs, and other automatic bodily functions. The range and duration of this Power are determined by its rank. Suitable distances are shown on column A of the Range Table. The Power normally affects only a single person; affecting more causes a decrease in duration of -1CS per additional person. The target\'s mind and senses are unaffected by the Power; the victim knows full well what is happening (even if he doesn\'s know why it\'s happening to him). The Power can reach across the dimensional barriers if it is combined with some way of breaching the dimensions. It can function normally if both hero and target are within another dimension.' },
	{ DieRoll: '66', Category: 'Plague Carrier', Description: 'The hero can contain within his body and release at will a variety of disease-causing microorganisms (bacteria, germs, viruses). The hero is immune to any disease (otherwise he\'d have died as soon as he gained this dubious Power), but he can instantly infect others at will with diseases of his choosing. Symptoms appear 1-10 turns later. Curiously, victims are not themselves contagious to others. Obviously, the Power alters the genetics of the disease-causing organisms and weakens them so that they can only survive within the hero and the first new body into which they are introduced. Upon the death of the victim or the end of the Power\'s duration, all the microbes die as well. This Power does have a beneficial side. Because of the hero\'s special ability to control microbes, he can actually cure others of disease. By means of a red FEAT, the hero can draw out of the target\'s body every last microbe of a particular type. Note: This only removes the cause of damage. It does not remove the effects of the disease. Example: Black Plague has a fondness for red-haired children, and cures a copper-haired tyke of smallpox. While the child will live, he still has the pockmarks. A character with this Power has to gain diseases, much as others would gain weapons, as he progresses. New characters begin with diseases common to everyday life, like chicken pox, mumps, influenza, and such. The character must actively seek out sources of new diseases in order to add them to his inner armory. This is done by consuming live cultures ("I don\'t get it! Why would anyone drink a vial of smallpox culture?") or by curing a diseased person in the manner explained earlier. This latter act will gain even the vilest villain a small flock of devoted people, all cured by him. The hero can use his Power against single targets. Multiple targets decrease his Power rank by -1CS per additional person. Rank determines the Intensity of the infection and duration of the symptoms. This Power can be negated or even destroyed by Ll/Biophysical Control or massive injections of anti-microbial drugs. The hero is then reduced to a normal being. The Power\'s ability to infect others can be negated by normal medical means or Powers like Self-Healing, Induced Healing, True Invulnerability, and this Power itself.'},
	{ DieRoll: '67-69', Category: 'Plant Control', Description: 'she hero can impart limited movement and self-awareness to unintelligent plants, enabling them to obey simple commands, communicate rudimentarily, and have accelerated growth within normal limits; rank determines the number and duration of control, with exceeding the limit decreasing duration by -1CS per additional 10%.' },
    { DieRoll: '70-71', Category: 'Plant Growth', Description: 'she hero has the ability to make plants grow nearly instantaneously, and far larger than normal. The Power can force a seed to sprout immediately and gives it the ability to thrive, even in the absence of normal nutrients (light, soil, and water). The hero can affect existing plants and seeds or use seeds and sprouts carried with him. In the latter case, the player must make a list of the types of seeds the hero carries (just as a weapons specialist needs a list of those with which he is proficient). This Power does not change the natural abilities of the affected plants; it only enhances them up to the Power\'s rank. This Power requires the player to develop some rudimentary knowledge of botany, since the more the player knows about plants, the more stunts the hero can perform. Typical plants used with this Power are: • Poison ivy: rash incapacitates foes • Kudzu: vines entangle targets • Briar: forms impassable barriers • Goldenrod: hayfever city • Oak: instant support for damaged buildings • Venus flytrap: Catch and hold foes Power rank determines the speed of plant growth and the rank of the affected plant\'s abilities. Growing a plant in normal conditions (adequate light, soil, and water) requires a Typical Intensity FEAT. Growing plants in less than adequate conditions (insufficient light, soil, or water; typical urban conditions) requires a Remarkable Intensity FEAT. Growing plants in openly hostile conditions (no light, soil, or water) requires an Unearthly Intensity FEAT. Because their metabolism is accelerated by this Power, the plants quickly die. The lifespan is 1/8 normal. As a rule of thumb, the player can use these guidelines for normal and accelerated lifespans: House plants-6 months/2 days Shrubbery-5 years/3 weeks Trees-100-1000 years/1-10 years The point of this is that your hero doesn\'s have to worry about filling the city with giant plants left over from old battles.

A green FEAT is needed for a weaker being, yellow for equal ranks, and red for a stronger one. The summoned being must perform a single task before departing for its home dimension.

Once control is established, the hero can order the undead to perform tasks, and control ceases once the task is completed but can be reinstated. This Power cannot affect living beings. The Power may be linked to MC13/Zombie Animation. Intelligent undead may later hold a grudge and attempt to destroy the hero or turn him into one of their own.

The Mage can store any spell except this Power, with the capacity determined by Enchantment\'s rank number. Contact with the target is required for full Enchantment; distance reduces spell rank by 1CS per 10 feet. Enchantment is disrupted by Psyche presence and cannot affect sentient beings, though non-sentient machines and certain parts of Cyborgs may be Enchanted. Enchantment can be interrupted, and protections such as Force Field vs. Magic or Magic Control can prevent it. The Mage must specify the stimulus for releasing the Magic, and the item reverts when all spells are released. Some spells cause permanent changes to the item.

The nature of the Source and link varies but may involve carrying a small item or returning to the Source at intervals. If the link is severed or the Source destroyed, the Mage has a finite supply of Magic equal to his Psyche rank. Each spell casts depletes the Magic by the spell\'s Effects rank number. The Mage needs to renew the link or repair the Source to continue drawing Magic. Example: Rolthes the Wizard uses a glowing Orb to draw his Power. If the Orb is stolen, he has a limited supply of Magic left based on his Psyche rank. This Power is more of a restraint than an active ability, offering a freebie and an additional Power slot.' },

This dimension is timeless and nearly infinite in volume. The Mage can shape the environment within it and control the emotions and attitudes of any beings inside. The size of the dimension is determined by the Mage\'s Power rank, with the equivalent of a cube whose side length is equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Typical rank creates a cube 6 miles on each side. The Gateway through which beings enter is the Mage\'s body or any part of it. Targets can resist entry using Strength, Agility, or Travel Powers, with a Strength FEAT required based on the Power rank. The Mage cannot draw in his own physical body but can send parts of himself using other powers like Energy Doppelganger or Illusory Duplication. The Power is limited by the size of the Gateway and the Mage’s ability to control what passes through.

The Power rank of the Magic determines the difficulty of the FEAT required to control it. If the Magic is internalized within another Mage, the FEAT difficulty is determined by the other Mage\'s Psyche. The Mage can control a specific type of spell or all spells of a particular Mage. Duration of control lasts for a number of minutes equal to the Mage\'s Power rank, after which it must be renewed. The Mage can choose from three forms of Magic Control: Manipulation (alter the flow or effects of Magic), Magnification/Reduction (increase or decrease the rank of Magic), and Negation (completely dispel Magic). The range of control is determined by the Mage\'s Power rank. Resistance to Magic Control can be achieved through Powers like Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, or opposing Magic Control.

The Mage can create a number of Powers equal to her Power rank number, including those she already possesses. These newly created Powers are ranked at -3CS of the Mage’s rank, and the recipient’s ability to improve them is based on their actions. The duration the recipient retains the Power depends on the Mage\'s Reason. A green FEAT gives one day times the combined Reason rank numbers of the Mage and recipient, yellow FEAT increases it to 10 days, and a red FEAT ensures permanency. Example: The arch-sorceress Jen\'smril confers Dimension Travel on Eleanor, with a yellow FEAT ensuring the Power lasts 400 days. Optional Powers include HyperIntelligence and Total Memory.

The Mage can force the puppet Mage to cast any Magic the controlling Mage possesses, though the characteristics of the spell remain unchanged (e.g., range, area of effect, and casting time). The control battle is determined by the Mage’s Power rank versus the victim\'s Psyche. A green FEAT overcomes a weaker Psyche, and the range decreases by -1CS per additional controlled being. The duration lasts as long as the Mage maintains concentration. Victims can resist every 10 turns with a Psyche FEAT. This Power works only against Mages and Magical Creatures. Magic Negation can free the victim. Voluntary cooperation from the target grants automatic control. Resistance can come from Powers like Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, or Magic Control.

Only one Power can be transferred with each spell. The recipient usually cooperates, but Resistance can be thwarted by moving the target out of range, disrupting the mechanism, or using Powers like Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, or Magic Control. Full rank transfer requires physical contact, and for every 10 feet of distance, the rank decreases by -1CS. The Mage can transfer Magic to multiple recipients, dividing the Magic equally between them. The duration of the transferred Magic depends on the combined Reason ranks of the Mage and the recipient.

The MageVampire can force nonliving, non-sentient Magical items or beings to release all their Magic, requiring a FEAT based on the highest rank of the Magic involved. If the target is living or sentient, the MageVampire must overcome the victim\'s Psyche to drain their Magic. Each successful FEAT drains an amount of Magic equal to the MageVampire\'s Power rank, distributed across all of the victim’s Magical Powers. Feeding continues until the MageVampire either stops or fails a FEAT, in which case the victim gains immunity to future attacks from that MageVampire. The drained Magic increases the MageVampire\'s Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and other Powers, but not the Vampirism itself. The MageVampire must feed regularly to avoid having their abilities drop by one point per hour. If all affected abilities drop to Shift-0, the MageVampire falls into a death-like trance until they drain more Magic to revive. The MageVampire must choose Weaknesses when created, which can increase their Power rank.

The Mage must feed regularly to maintain their energy levels, as their rank numbers drop by 1 per hour if not. If the Mage fails a FEAT, they are repelled and the victim gains immunity to their attacks. The Mage can stop feeding voluntarily with a Psyche FEAT, but a red FEAT results in a feeding frenzy.

The Nemesis for this Power is Iron Will.' },
    { DieRoll: '96-100', Category: 'Warding', Description: 'she Mage can create areas of latent Power in any desired location. The Ward is designated by a special substance or mark. The mage decides what specific Powers the Ward possesses and what the triggering stimulus will be. When that stimulus occurs, the Ward releases all its power in a single turn, generally in the direction of whatever created the stimulus. The Power\'s rank determines how great a variety of Wards the Mage can create. The rank number is also the number of Powers he can incorporate into his Wards, even if the Mage cannot directly use those Powers himself. Each Ward\'s intensity rank is the same as the Mage\'s own rank. For example, a Mage with Excellent Warding can create 20 different Wards, each possessing Excellent Intensity rank. A Remarkable Intensity FEAT enables the Mage to create a single-use Ward. An Amazing Intensity FEAT enables him to create a self-renewing Ward. The Power rank number is also the maximum number of Wards a Mage can have in existence at any one time. If the Mage tries to surpass this number, his oldest still-existing Ward harmlessly vanishes. The minimum distance between Wards is one foot for each point of the Wards\' combined Intensity rank numbers. For example, a Feeble and a Monstrous Ward must be separated by at least 82 feet. If the Mage attempts to place a new ward within range of an existing one, the new one will not function. If the new Ward\'s area of effect would overlap with another Ward, the new Ward cannot have the full Intensity rank. The new Ward will have a maximum rank that will only touch the edge of the earlier Ward\'s range. For example, a Good Ward covers an area of ten-foot radius. If the Mage tries to create a Remarkable Ward within twenty feet of the Good Ward, he discovers he can only create a Good ward at best. If he backs off another twenty feet, though, he can create the Intensity he desires. The triggering mechanism can be any condition stated by the Mage at the time of creation. Normally Wards are triggered by the close passage of a living being. Thus they are often found near doorways or in passages. Once created, Wards last until they are depleted or destroyed. Given the durability of modern building materials, a Ward can last for about a century or so. Wards can be destroyed by demolishing the surface on which they are placed or by the use of Magic Control/ Negation. Wards can be detected by a number of ways. The simplest is the brute force method of triggering them (also called the really stupid method). The presence of a Ward can be revealed by either Energy, Magic, Power, or Psionic Detection. Shortly after the Mage has been created, the Player should make up a list of at least half of the possible Wards he can create. The Player should return to the Power Generation tables on pages 14-16 and randomly generate all the Powers the Mage can incorporate into Wards. Wards that employ a special variation on normal Power use, such as a Power Stunt, should be treated as individual Wards. Example: Consider two different Wards ' }

    { DieRoll: '01-05', Category: 'Bonding', Description: 'she hero has the ability to join two or more targets together on a molecular level. The effect is the same as if the targets were glued or welded together. In actuality, the hero has induced molecular adhesion. A submicroscopic examination would fail to reveal any foreign material (such as glue) or disturbances in the normal arrangement of the target\'s structure (such as the distortion caused by welding). The Bonding is so powerful that attempting to sever its effect results in physical damage to either of the Bonded targets because the only way to forcibly separate two Bonded objects is to tear the surface of one or both of them. This causes Typical wounds to a living target. The range for Bonding is limited to Contact only. The hero need not touch the actual area to be Bonded, although the hero needs to touch the two targets somewhere in order to direct the Power\'s effect. Once the hero is touching both targets and has begun to manifest his Power, Bonding occurs at any point where the two targets are in contact with each other. The Bonding process takes any number of turns, depending both on the hero\'s Power rank and the desired material strength of the Bonding. The first turn produces a Bonding of Feeble material strength. Each turn the Bonding process continues raises that material strength +1CS, up to the limit of the Power rank. At any point the hero can cease to use his Power and thus produce Bondings of varied strengths. Example: K. Z. Glew has Good Bonding and is testing his Power on a number of blocks. When he holds two together for two turns, he produces a Poor Bonding. Holding two together for three turns produces a Typical Bonding. Holding two bricks for four turns produces a Good Bonding; in fact, K. Z. could concentrate on the same two bricks all day and not be able to exceed that Good Bonding. The duration of the Bonding is determined by a Power FEAT at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT creates a Bond that lasts a number of turns equal to the hero\'s Reason rank number times 100. A yellow FEAT increases the multipliers to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT ensures a permanent Bonding. If the Bonding is temporary, its effects end without a trace at the expiration of the time limit. This is a Power that readily combines with many of the other listings in this book. Combining it with Webcasting produces an equivalent to Spiderman\'s web. Weapons Tinkering produces an equivalent to the Trapster\'s glue gun. Chemical Touch produces a natural adhesive coating on the hero\'s body. Combustion or Fire Generation produces napalm. There are more but I\'ll leave them to the player\'s imagination to devise. The Power can only affect solids. Liquid, gaseous, ethereal, and Phasing matter are immune to this Power\'s effects. Once Bonded, matter cannot Phase as a means of escaping the adhesion; doing so causes Typical damage as the Bonded surface is left behind. Transition from solid to either liquid or gaseous state will work to free the Bonded matter without physical damage, although this is not an option for most people. Bonding only occurs on the surface and does not penetrate more than 1/16th of an inch into any Bonded material. The effect this has on living targets is that only the epidermis is affected. As it does not affect liquids, the Power automatically penetrates any coating that might otherwise protect the target. Optional Powers include Missile Creation, Spray, Webcasting, and Weapons Tinkering. The Nemeses are Phasing, Body Transformation, and Energy Body.' },
    { DieRoll: '06-17', Category: 'Collection', Description: 'she hero can cause any desired material to collect in a specific location. This material must already be present and diffused throughout the hero\'s vicinity, whether in the air, water, soil, or scattered across the ground. The Collection area has a radius determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on column C of the Range Table inside this book’s cover. For example, an Incredible rank can collect material from as far as 25 miles away. Collected material instantly teleports to the designated Collection site. The site must be in line of sight of the hero and within his Power\'s range. The hero can collect per turn a maximum amount of material measured in the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number. This assumes, of course, that enough material exists within the vicinity in order to be Collected. Any material of any nature can be Collected. There is a partial exemption to this rule in regards to living beings. The Power can only Collect living beings whose weight is within the weight limits for the Power; if the being weighs more, the Power cannot affect them aside from a brief tug. If the Power is used to Collect the bodily products of living beings, player and Judges are to assume that so little is drawn from each being that no harm results. For example, a character could Collect a mass of blood without having to worry that he bled some stranger to death. The Power does not alter the state of any matter either before or after Collection. The desired matter must be in the basic chemical formulation desired. Desired materials that are in some altered state are not affected by the Power. For example, trying to Collect steel in a junkyard full of rust will lead to naught. The exception is if the desired material is in either a state of solution or suspension, since neither actually affects the chemical nature of the material. For example, imagine your hero is standing at the seaside and practicing his Power. He cannot Collect the hydrogen bound into the water but he could Collect salt, gold, or anything else dissolved into seawater. Collecting salt is easy; a Remarkable Power can Collect a man-sized pile within a minute\'s time. Gold is harder; each cubic mile of seawater contains only a few ounces of gold. Due to some unexplained limitation to this Power, it cannot randomly Collect foreign materials found within the bodies of anyone within the Power\'s range. Common foreign materials include tooth fillings, prostheses, sutures, and drugs. If the hero must Collect such materials from a body, for example if he knows arsenic has been swallowed by someone, the conditions increase in difficulty. The hero must be in contact with the source of the desired material and the hero must make a red FEAT to withdraw the material without harming the donor. Failure to do so means the material is still locked within the target\'s body. Ethereal and Phasing matter can be Collected. They just can\'s be held for any length of time without consciously and repeatedly using the Power to return such matter to the Collection site. This Power is most commonly linked to the Matter Control and Conversion Powers as a way to gather sufficient raw material to permit the other Powers to function. These are listed as Optional Powers. Even if used by itself, this Power can be used effectively. Matter can be Collected to form a protective shield or to entrap a foe in a suddenly appearing pile of debris. Dirt or water can be Collected to smother a fire or dampen escaping radiation. The hero is free to develop various Power Stunts using suddenly materialized matter. The complexity of the material to be collected determines what Intensity FEAT is required. Raw, amorphous materials can be collected in a dusty pile by a green FEAT. Common examples include metals, dirt, and water. Formed or complex material requires a yellow FEAT to collect in recognizable form. Examples include bricks, edibles, and comic books. Biological material requires a red FEAT, whether the hero is trying to collect bile or hamsters. Optional Powers include Crystallization, Matter Animation, Micro Environment, Molding, Weather, Combustion, Elemental Conversion, and Molecular Conversion. The Nemesis is Matter Animation.' },
    { DieRoll: '18-22', Category: 'Crystallization', Description: 'she hero can transform any target material into a gemlike material that possesses Power rank material strength. Crystallization occurs because the hero has the ability to shape the molecular bonds of normally amorphous matter into a crystal matrix of great strength. The Crystallization can occur at any site within the hero\'s line of sight and range; distances are determined by the Power rank and can be found on column C of the Range Table on the inside cover. The newly formed Crystal is initially stationary; it cannot be launched like a missile (unless the hero possesses Missile Creation, but I\'m getting ahead of myself). It can be formed in such a position that gravity immediately affects it. Crystallization automatically affects non-living, unprotected, stationary targets. Moving targets require the hero to make an Agility FEAT in order to hit the target. If Crystallization is used as an attack against a living target, it can be resisted by the usual methods. Methods of protecting a target from being Crystallized include Force Field vs. Energy Attack, Resistance to Energy Attack, True Invulnerability, and various Magics and Power Controls. Crystal can be formed in any shape the hero desires. The amount of Crystal the hero can create in a single turn is the number of square feet equal to the Power rank number. The material to be transformed into Crystal is drawn from particles in the air or from the target itself. Solid targets can themselves be Crystallized. If the Power is used on a living target, innate safeguards incorporated into the Power place the target into a semi-state of Suspended Animation; all life functions temporarily cease but the target remains aware of its condition and surroundings. A Crystallized lifeform must remain intact if the process is to be reversed. If the Crystallized lifeform is shattered, the transformation is permanent. Note: the shards of a shattered, Crystallized lifeform all possess some of the victim\'s lifeforce; the percentage of the victim\'s Psyche possessed by a particular shard is equal to the percentage of the original body represented by the shard. Such shards can be used to create powerful Magic. Such shards can also lead to later Plot Complications. ("You don\'s understand. The gem in the necklace I gave Helen was part of Leviathan!") Normally Crystallization is only temporary. The duration of a given Crystal is the number of minutes equal to the Power rank number. At the expiration of this time, the Crystal reverts back to its original material. If the Crystallization was directed in the air the original material was probably dust particles. As mentioned earlier, if the Crystallization was used to transform a living target and that Crystal was subsequently shattered, the transformation is made permanent. (This rule is purposefully intended to spare the Judge and players from dealing with the hamburger that would be created if the formerly living target did revert to its original state.) For game purposes, the category of "living target" can be expanded by the Judge to encompass any of the Physical Types for player characters and NPCs. The Power can be combined with other Powers listed in this book. As mentioned before, Missiles can give the Crystals momentum and range. Weapons Creation can specialize in crystalline instruments of destruction. Body Armor or Body Coating can be a suit of flexible crystalline armor with that gives Power rank Resistance to physical or energy attacks. Vision-based Detection Powers can be achieved by the hero spontaneously forming optical devices and lenses of crystal. If the hero has an exotic Physical Type, perhaps he can himself be composed of living crystal.' },
    { DieRoll: '23-29', Category: 'Diminution', Description: 'she hero can reduce the size of a target. The target must be in line of sight and within one area of the hero. Any material can be Diminished by this Power with the sole exception of material that has already been Diminished by an equal or higher rank of this Power. In such a case, the would-be target is assumed to already be Diminished to a further point than the hero could reach anyway. The level to which the hero can Diminish a target is determined by the Power rank. Levels appropriate to this Power are: Resultant Size Rank (% of Original Size) FE PR TY GD EX RE IN AM FN SP MN WN UN X Y Z CL1000 CL3000 CL5000 50% 25% 12.5% 6.25% 3% 1% .5% .25% .1% .01% .001% .0001% .00001% .000001% .0000001% .000000001% .00000000001% .00000000000000001% .000000000000000000000 000000000001%. In practical terms, a Diminishment rank of Shift X, Y, or Z is sufficient to reduce a normal-sized human to the size of a cell. Either CL1000 or CL3000 will reduce him to atomic scale. CL5000 reduces a human to such a point where he can enter a Microverse such as Jarella\'s world of Kaa. Anote on Microverses: These are miniature dimensions that can be reached by a person undergoing extreme size reduction. The act of Shrinking causes the person to breach the Dimensional Barriers and reach a chosen Microverse. The worlds within a Microverse roughly correspond to but are not actually atoms or molecules. Once within a Microverse, the Dimension traveler finds himself in an environment that approximates conditions in the larger, outer world. Microverses may themselves contain even smaller Microverses. Even our own world may in fact be a Microverse to some inconceivably larger Macroverse. The duration of Diminution on a target is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used on the target. A green Reason FEAT gives a duration of the Reason rank number times 100 turns. A yellow FEAT increases this to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the diminution permanent; in such a case the only way the target can return to its original size is through use of Enlargement, Magic, or Power Negation. There are three very different ways to create the effect of Diminution. Each has its own mechanism and peculiar properties as a result of that mechanism. The player can either choose for himself or let a random die roll determine which form. Atomic Collapse—The hero decreases the distance between the target\'s atoms and subatomic particles. The target does not lose weight as it shrinks. Rather, it becomes increasingly dense and could eventually collapse into neutronium (CL3000 Diminution) or even a black hole (CL5000 Diminution). Strength is unaffected by the change in size but leverage becomes increasingly difficult at smaller sizes. Atomic Reduction—The hero decreases the number of atoms in the target\'s body. The lost matter is either disintegrated (if the Diminution is permanent) or temporarily removed from the target\'s plane of existence and stored on another plane until it is needed to return the target to its original size. Mass and strength both decrease as the target Shrinks; the lower ranks are proportional to the target\'s new size. The target becomes increasingly simple in structure and reach a stage where the remaining structure is too simple to sustain the lifeforce of a living target. This occurs at Shift X rank. If the Diminution is temporary, the target\'s lifeforce is stored on the same plane as the displaced matter that normally forms his body. At Shift Z Diminution, the target consists of only a single molecule which immediately vanishes when the next rank is reached. Atomic Reduction—This is the most common form of Diminution and the only form that permits the target to enter a Microverse. The hero can reduce the size of the atoms and subatomic particles themselves, thus reducing the overall size in a proportional manner. Mass and physical strength are reduced a proportional amount. While this Power has more advantages than the other forms, it has a deadly disadvantage. As the target\'s atoms shrink, they are no longer able to interact with other, normal sized atoms. As a result, a living target is unable to breathe the air or consume food or water. Seen in this light, this form of Diminution is the equivalent of a Fatal attack. Fortunately, there is a 95% chance the Power envelopes the target in an energy field that shrinks anything within one foot (proportional to the target\'s current size) of the target to the same size as the target. This allows the target to breathe, drink, and eat. The existence of this field is randomly determined at the time the source of the Diminution is created. If the hero lacks such field, then any target must have its own supply of proportionally-sized consumables. Even non-living targets can be affected in that the Power effectively insulates them from electricity, since normal-sized electrons cannot flow into a Diminished conductor. Treat this as rank level Resistance to Electricity. If the field exists, electrons are automatically Shrunken to permit conductivity. It is assumed that when the Power is used, the hero intends to Diminish the entire target. If the hero specifies, he can attempt to shrink only part of a target. Since this is equivalent to tearing the target apart, a Power FEAT determined by the Material Strength of the target is required to do such an act. Example: Sizemaster has possesses Remarkable Diminution. Seeing an uproar at his local bank, he wanders in to see what\'s up. He discovers The Shocker trying desperately to free people trapped in a safe and he decides to assist the rescue. He locates a section of the safe away from The Shocker and begins to manifest his Power. The safe is made of steel and reinforced concrete and has a Remarkable Material Strength. Good, Sizemaster only needs to make a yellow FEAT to Diminish a hatch in the safe\'s wall. Within twelve seconds he has Diminished a six-foot-wide area into a one-inch-wide plug, which drops out of the wall and rolls around on the floor. Sizemaster is helping the trapped people out of the safe when Shocker finally burns through the opposite wall. Later the two rivals seal the hole Sizemaster made by holding the plug in place as returned to its original size. The Power can automatically effect a non-living, stationary, unprotected target. Moving targets require the hero to make an Agility FEAT to hit the target with his Power. Living targets are allowed to resist the Power\'s effects in the same way they would resist any energy attack Targets can be protected from Diminution by such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, certain Magics and Power Controls, and the simultaneous use of an opposing Enlargement Power. Atomic Dispersal opposes Atomic Collapse, Atomic Gain opposes Atomic Reduction, and Atomic Growth opposes Atomic Shrinkage. If the opponent lacks the matching form of Enlargement he can still try to negate the effects of Diminution with whatever form he possesses; the results can get a little weird, though. The Nemeses are those Powers mentioned in the previous paragraph.' },
    { DieRoll: '30-39', Category: 'Disruption', Description: 'she hero can destroy a target\'s physical structure without resorting to a physical or overt energy attack. The molecular bonds that give a target its solidity are directly Disrupted, with the result that the target collapses into dust, sand, liquid, or even vapor. The Material Strength of the target determines what Intensity FEAT is required. For example, asphalt has Good Material Strength and consequently would require a Good Intensity FEAT to destroy. The hero can Disrupt any target within both line-of-sight and range. The range is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on Column A of the Range Table on the inside cover. The amount of matter the hero can Disrupt in a single turn is the number of pounds equal to his Power rank number. If the player chooses when creating the character, he can increase either range or amount affected any number of +CS by decreasing the other factor an equal number of -CS. Example: an initial rank of Good can be altered by up to 3CS and produce results as varied as Feeble range (Contact only) and Incredible effect (40 pounds) or Incredible range (11 areas) and Feeble effect (two pounds). Also when creating the character, the player can choose whether to make the Disruption permanent or temporary. Choosing the temporary option raises the Power rank +1CS. The duration of the Disruption is determined by a separate Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT gives a duration equal to 100 turns times the Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the Disruption permanent. At the expiration of the duration, the Disrupted matter reforms in its original shape although not necessarily in its original location. If the target is living, the Power has the peculiar effect of placing the target in a state of semi-Suspended Animation. All life function cease for the duration but the target somehow retains consciousness and awareness. This Power is often incorporated into weapons systems. A Disruptor Gun can be designed and built by a Reason rank and an expenditure of Resource points equal to the Power rank desired for the weapon. Stationary, non-living, unprotected targets are automatically affected by the Power. Moving targets require the hero to make an Agility FEAT in order to hit the target. Living targets are allowed to resist the Power in the same manner they could resist any energy attack. Targets can be protected from Disruption by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, a combination of Collection and Molding, certain Magics, and certain Power Controls. Any of these can reduce the Intensity of the Disruption by the opposing Power\'s rank. The Judge is free to decide for himself the results of partial protection from Disruption. The Nemeses are any of the Powers.' },
    { DieRoll: '40-46', Category: 'Enlargement', Description: 'she hero can increase the size of any target. The target can be of any nature and must be within both line-of-sight and one area of the hero\'s location. Any material can be enlarged with one exception; the Power cannot affect any target that has already been Enlarged by another Power of equal or greater rank. In such a case, the would-be target is assumed to already be Enlarged past any point the hero could have Enlarged it to anyway. The amount the hero can Enlarge a target is determined by the Power rank. The levels to which the hero can Enlarge a target are shown below: Resultant size Rank (x original size) FE 1.5X, PR 2X, TY 3X, GD 4X, EX 6X, RM 8X, IN 10X, AM 12X, FN 15X, SP 20X, MN 25X, WN 30X, UN 40X, X 50X, Y 100X, Z 200X, CL1000 500X, CL3000 1000X, CL5000 10,000X. The duration of the Enlargement is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT gives the Enlargement a duration of 100 turns times the hero\'s Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns times the Reason number. A red FEAT makes the Enlargement permanent. There are three different mechanisms by which Enlargement can occur. Each form has a different set of innate properties. When creating the character, the player must decide which form the hero has. The player can either select one or let the dice randomly determine it for him. Die Roll Form 01-30 Atomic Dispersal, 31-60 Atomic Growth, 61-00 Atomic Gain. Atomic Dispersal—The Power causes the spaces between the atoms and subatomic particles to increase, thus increasing overall size. Mass remains the same despite any increase in size, causing the target\'s density to drop. Material Strength decreases -1CS with each doubling in size. Eventually, at Shift X Enlargement a solid target reaches a stage where it is less dense than air and can drift off. At Class 1000 rank and beyond, the target becomes effectively intangible to contact with normal matter. Atomic Gain—The Power causes the target to gain additional atoms. These are automatically incorporated into the target to duplicate and augment existing molecular structures. As the targets gains new atoms, the size and mass of the target increase proportionally. Where do the new atoms come from? There are three possibilities. One theory holds that Molecular Creation creates them from the hero\'s force of will. A second theory suggests Molecular and Elemental Conversion are responsible; the new atoms are simply Converted air molecules. The third explanation is that the hero somehow taps into another dimension, one that contains nothing but the raw material for this Power and the Matter Creation Powers and also provides a storage place for the matter displaced by Shrinking, Diminution, and Disintegration. This last idea could lead to a Plot Complication wherein the hero accidentally draws something More than raw material from that unknown dimension. I\'ll leave it to you to decide which explanation you accept as the truth. As the target expands, it gains real strength sufficient to move its new mass. Real strength increases +1CS for each +2CS of Enlargement the target is exposed to. Example: The Power is used on a normal adult six feet in height, 200 pounds in weight, and possessing Typical Strength. Enlargement Strength/Rank Weight Max. Lift The target\'s other Primary and Secondary Abilities remain unaffected. The disadvantages of great size negate the advantages. However, Health seems to increase because physical attacks do less relative damage. For example, a single bullet could kill a normal sized person but would be little more than a high-velocity grain of sand to a giant. The damage done by Physical Attacks decreases -1CS for each +2CS of Enlargement. Note: the damage that didn\'s affect the giant might be fatal when he reverts to normal size. Wounds shrink but bullets do not. Atomic Growth—The target\'s atoms and subatomic particles actually increase in size, thus increasing the target\'s overall size. Mass increases proportionally. The target\'s Strength increases only enough to match his greater weight; Lifting Strength does not increase. There is a dangerous drawback to this form of Enlargement. As the target\'s atoms grow, they become unable to interact with normal atoms. The result is that the target is unable to breathe, drink, or eat. Fortunately there is a 95% chance that the Power envelops the target in an energy field that enlarges any atoms within its effect to the same scale as the target. The existence of this field must be determined at the time the hero is created. If the field is not present, the target must have a proportionally-sized supply of consumables or this Power is considered a Fatal attack. The lack of the field has one advantage in that Electricity cannot flow between normal-sized and Enlarged conductors. The Power thus provides rank level Resistance to Electricity. It is always assumed that the hero intends to Enlarge the entire target\'s body. If the hero intends to Enlarge a specific area of a target, he must make a special effort to do so. Since this has the effect of tearing the target apart, the hero must make a Power FEAT based on the Material Strength of the target. For example, a brick wall has Good Material Strength. A hero with Typical Enlargement would need to make a red FEAT to enlarge a specific section of the wall, while a hero with an Incredible rank would only have to make a green FEAT. The effects on the entire target if only a section of it is Enlarged vary by case and by degree of Enlargement. The most common result of a section of Enlarged matter surrounded by normal matter is that one of the two sections shattered, depending on which is the weaker section. Atomic Dispersal weakens Material Strength, Atomic Growth doesn\'s alter it, and Atomic Gain increases it. Judges should use this guide and their imagination to decide the results of specific Enlargement. The Power automatically affects stationary, non-living, unprotected targets. Moving targets require the hero to make an Agility FEAT to hit. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power just as they could any Energy Attack. Targets can be protected from Enlargement by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, Certain Magics and Power Controls, and any of the Shrinking or Diminution Powers used simultaneously to the Enlarging attack. The opposing forms of these are Collapse vs. Dispersal, Reduction vs. Gain, and Shrinkage vs. Growth. Only the matching form can completely protect a target from unwanted Enlargement; while the other two will apparently work, the final result can be a little weird if extreme ranks of Power are employed. The Nemeses are those Powers mentioned in the previous paragraph.' },
    { DieRoll: '47-51', Category: 'Geoforce', Description: 'she hero can detect and control geological forces. These include plate movement, stress, faults, and vulcanism. This Power only applies to natural rock and semi-natural materials such as concrete, cement, and asphalt. Radically altered material (steel, plastic) is not directly affected by the Power. This Power has two ranges, both based on the Power rank. The ability to detect forces and materials within the earth has a range shown on Column C of the Range Table on the inside cover. The ability to actually control those forces is more limited and is determined on Column B. For example, a hero with Remarkable Geoforce can detect forces 12 miles distant but can only control those forces within one mile of her location. The Detection aspect of this Power enables the hero to sense a variety of earth-related things. These include ground temperature (green FEAT), general mineral composition (green), specific minerals (red), locate caves (green), locate beings moving within the earth (yellow), identify faultlines and stress points (yellow), and communicate with beings made of rock (red). The active aspect of this Power enables the hero to accelerate, slow, or alter the direction of natural geological forces. The hero can affect plate movement; this can create Power rank tremors or reduce the intensity of existing tremors by the Power rank number. The hero can accelerate erosion by decreasing the Material Strength of exposed rock. The flow of magma within the earth can be redirected to anywhere the hero wants an instant baby volcano to erupt. By magnifying existing faults and decreasing the rock\'s Material Strength, the hero can create openings in the earth. These can be instant pits, valleys, caves, or tunnels. The effects of the Power are permanent alterations to the landscape. Baby volcanoes don\'s last very long, though, if the area didn\'s have a previous history of vulcanism. For example, during her tenure with the New Mutants, Magma has created baby volcanoes in such places as Rio de Janeiro\'s harbor, the living room of Professor Xavier\'s mansion, and an apartment in Manhattan. Such freakish volcanoes immediately cool down once the Power is no longer supporting their existence; heat is lost at a rate of -1CS per hour. For example, the volcano in the X-Mansion was cool enough to sit on by the time Professor X came home a few hours later. It is assumed that the cooling effect extends all the way down back through the ground to where the magma came from in the first place; otherwise all these baby volcanoes would act as conduits for later, normal vulcanism. The amount of matter the Power can effect is awesome. The Power can affect a maximum amount of rock equivalent to ten tons for each point of the Power rank number. For example, Magma\'s Monstrous Geoforce can affect 800 tons (1.5 million pounds!) at a range of up to six miles. The Power can be expanded into a variety of Power Stunts, such as induced Avalanches and sculpting chambers in the earth. The latter example is also a way for the hero to make some money on the side by creating "secret underground headquarters" on commission. The giant caves that litter the pages of comic books do not occur in real life, people. A curious use of the Power is to communicate with beings who are themselves composed of natural rock. The Power provides the hero with a seismic equivalent of Telepathy. Such beings include Golems, Earth Elementals, and planetary beings such as Ego the Living Planet. Is Mother Earth alive in your campaign? If she is, then this Power will let your hero talk to her. The Nemeses for this Power include itself, Disintegration, and Phasing.' },
    { DieRoll: '52-61', Category: 'Matter Animation', Description: 'she hero can alter the flow of any raw matter, impart movement to stationary matter, and shape such matter into any desired form. The Power can only affect matter that is in a relatively natural state. It cannot affect mechanical objects or material that is now or had once been alive. There are three basic forms of this Power, each with dominion over a state of matter. When creating the hero, the player must choose one of these forms for the character. He can do this himself or let the dice choose for him. Die Roll Form 01-20 Air Animation, 21-50 Liquid Animation, 51-00 Solid Animation. Air Animation—The hero can directly control the movement of gases and vapors and indirectly control the movement of material suspended in the air, such as smoke, dust, steam, and so on. He can create winds of speeds equal to Power rank speed (see the Airspeed table on the inside cover). He can control the actions of air, wind, clouds, and potentially even the weather. The hero can use air either defensively or offensively by forming shields or gales of Power rank strength. Note: Air attacks cannot penetrate Force Fields or an aerial shield of higher Intensity. The Power can be developed into Power Stunts such as Gliding, Whirlwind Flight, and limited Weather Control. The forms of Weather Control available to the hero all depend on stirring up the air. These include bringing in storms, fog, tornadoes, and suddenly bringing two air masses of differing temperature together to form either fog or lightning. Liquid Animation—The hero can directly control the movement of liquids and indirectly control material suspended in liquid (mud, cake batter). He can create currents and waves that can travel at Power rank speed (see the Water Travel table on the inside cover) and do Power rank damage to anything in their path. Liquid can be animated to resist gravity and act as if it were temporarily a solid of rank level Material Strength. Liquids can be used as a shield that reduces the Intensity of Energy Attacks by the Power rank number. It can be further refined into a variety of Power Stunts, such as forming propulsion systems or being shaped into air bubbles with "solid" floors. Solid Animation—The hero can alter the condition of solid matter, so long as it is not biological or mechanical in nature. He can give the solid movement, reshape it to any form, and even give it the semblance of life. Solids can travel at Power rank speed (see the Land Travel table inside the cover) either across the ground or through the air. The hero can Mold the solid into any single mass. Solids retain their Material Strength but can be Animated to do Power rank damage to other targets. The hero can create Golems or simulated Elementals that obey his every whim; such creations are only sophisticated puppets that possess no more life than does a marionette. Animated solids possess a Lifting Strength equal to the Power rank. The Power can be refined into a variety of Power Stunts, such as turning an opponent\'s weapon against him, creating self-tying knots, and creating flying platforms that can carry the hero across the ground or through the air. The range at which the hero can Animate Matter is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on Column B of the Range Table. The maximum amount that can be Animated is a mass weighing the equivalent of 1000 pounds times the Power rank number. For example, a Feeble rank can move one ton; in liquid terms this is the weight of a water bed. Matter remains Animated as long as the hero concentrates on using this Power. Judges are free to develop their own criteria to determine how well and how long a hero can do this in a given situation. Any material can be Animated, as long as it is within the restrictions on the chosen form of that Power. Any reshaping done to the target is permanent; of course, this only applies to solids. The possibilities for both construction and vandalism are immense. At the time the hero is created, the player has the option of raising the Power rank +1CS by further specializing the Power\'s range of effect to a specific compound or type of matter. Examples of specializations include Powers that specifically Animate steam, water, oil, ice, clay, and so on. The Nemeses for this Power include itself and Disintegration.' },
    { DieRoll: '62-68', Category: 'Machine Animation', Description: 'she hero can control the movement of anything mechanical. It is as if the hero were a combination remote-control panel and power source. The machines can only perform those functions for which they were designed. While under the influence of the Power, the affected machines can function even in the absence of a normal power supply, such as would be provided by an electric cord, wound spring, or miniature nuclear generator. The only new function the hero can give a machine is limited ground movement. Affected machines can travel at -2CS Power rank speed by sliding or rocking along the ground; see the Surface Movement table inside the cover. If the machine already incorporates a means of propulsion (wheels, tracks, table legs), it can travel at Power rank speed; see ditto. The Power can affect any single machine within range of the Power; Column B of the Range Table gives the appropriate limits. If the hero attempts to control several machines simultaneously, the Range decreases -1CS for each additional machine the hero is controlling. For example, a hero with Good Machine Animation can control a single machine 10 areas away, two machines 5 areas away, three machines within his area, or four machines if he is touching all of them at once (an interesting Agility FEAT, I suppose). The Power is primarily intended to control normally non-sentient devices, which are considered to have a Psyche of zero. If the hero tries to gain control of a Robot or the mechanical part of a Cyborg, greater effort is needed. It becomes a contest of wills, as the hero\'s Power tries to overcome the target\'s Psyche. The Psyche in question is either that of the Robotic brain or the living mind of a Cyborg; if the Cyborg incorporates both living and mechanical minds, only the Psyche of the mechanical mind is used to determine the difficulty of the FEAT. The latter determines what Intensity FEAT is required. Example: A Poor rank of Machine Animation could seize control of a Dreadnought\'s Feeble Psyche with a green FEAT and Ultron-11\'s Poor Psyche with a yellow FEAT, but couldn\'s begin to touch Jocasta\'s Good Psyche. Attempting to wrest control of the Iron Man armor would require a red FEAT if either Tony Stark or Jim Rhodes were wearing it at the time but would automatically succeed if the armor were, say, hanging in a closet somewhere. To protect against such interference, High Technology types would need to develop circuitry that would give the equivalent of a desired Psyche rank to the machine. Optional Powers include Communication with Cybernetics, Communication with Non-Living Matter (limited to machines only), and Matter Animation.' },
    { DieRoll: '69-73', Category: 'Micro-Environment', Description: 'she hero can alter his immediate surroundings to create a miniature climate around himself. The Micro-Environment always contains fresh clean air (or water or methane or whatever the hero breathes) at any temperature and pressure the hero desires. The Micro-Environment incorporates a Force Field that protects it from any factor that might harm or even annoy the hero, such as rain, poisonous gases, extreme temperatures, or the pressure that naturally results from having three miles of ocean over your head. In such cases, the Micro-Environment automatically excludes potentially hazardous gases and liquids and reduces the Intensity of pressure, extreme temperature, and high gravity by the Power rank number. Lesser or equal Intensities are canceled out, while higher ranks only penetrate in diminished form. The Power automatically Collects the desired materials into a sphere around the hero; if no such materials are available, the Power employs an innate form of Matter Creation or Conversion to produce those materials. The Force Field maintains the desired pressure, temperature, and gravity levels while enclosing the desired materials and shielding the hero from the undesired ones. If the hero requires a surface to stand on but none is available, the Power provides one by solidifying a section of the Force Field. The Power is primarily intended to protect the hero when he is in places other than his home environment. It can be used to protect him from extreme variations in that home environment though, should the hero so choose. Thus the Power can be used to protect the hero in the middle of a house fire, gas leak at a fertilizer plant, radiation spill at a laboratory, a thunderstorm, or a smog alert in Los Angeles. The Power can be used to Resist the effects of Air or Water Animation, Weather Control, Heat, or Cold Generation; the Intensity of the attack is reduced by the Power rank number. The Micro-Environment has a maximum radius in-feet equal to the Power rank number. Normally it is a sphere centered in the hero but she can shape it or direct it to another location if she so desires. The maximum range at which the hero can direct the Micro-Environment is determined by the Power rank; appropriate distances are shown on Column B on the Range Table. The maximum volume of the Micro-Environment is the equivalent of a sphere whose radius equals the Power rank number. Figuring out the maximum volume of other shapes requires a doing a bit of geometry. Example: A rank of Good can produce a sphere of 3.14(10-cubed) or 3,140 cubic feet. This can be shaped into a rectangular "tunnel" 10 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 31 feet long. I suggest that anyone with this Power figure out as soon as possible how big a sphere/ hemisphere/ column/ tunnel/ cone/ etcetera he can make with his Power rank. If you don\'s, the Judge is liable to say that mysterious changes in the environment prevent your hero\'s Power from working. The Power only protects the hero from environmental effects or Powers that employ aspects of the Environment. Beside the Powers mentioned earlier, this Power will also provide limited protection against Electrical Control, Electrical Generation, Coldshaping, Gravity Manipulation, Hard Radiation and its Control, Thermal Control, Plague Carrier, Geoforce, Spray, and Pheromones, but only if the offending Power originates outside the Micro-Environment. As hinted at before, the Power can be used to create any environment the hero desires, provided it is beneficial to whatever nature of being is inside its protection. Of course, what is a marvelous climate for one being could be instantly fatal to another. Consider the Micro-Environment created by beings that thrive on super-heated steam or swim in liquid helium. Player characters are limited to producing only those Micro-Environment that will help the beings inside. Villainous and Mind Controlled NPC heroes are able to pervert the Power and create toxic Micro-Environment. In such a case, the Power is treated as an attack and the intended victim is urged to Resist it in any way he can. The Nemeses are either Air or Liquid Animation, depending on the nature of the Micro-Environment.' },
    { DieRoll: '74-83', Category: 'Molding', Description: 'she hero can shape any solid material into any desired shape. The shaped material retains its original chemical nature. If the target is living, its internal anatomy is rearranged in such a way that permits life to continue without loss of Health. The new shape can be of any complexity; even intricate machines can be created if the proper materials are available. The newly-Molded target can be Animated, even if the original material or the current shape is normally incapable of movement. This movement is accomplished by the simple act of continually re-Molding the target (think of it in terms of stop-motion animation). Molded targets retain their basic Material Strength. New shapes may alter the load-bearing capacity of the material. For example, a arch can bear greater weight than a plane and a honeycomb is about the strongest shape there is. Using the Power destructively is easy; using it constructively is harder and requires the player to have some knowledge of basic Engineering. The maximum range at which the hero can Mold a target is determined by the Power rank. Appropriate distances are shown on Column A of the Range Table. The amount of material the hero can Mold is a mass weighing 100 pounds times the Power rank number. When creating the hero, the player has the option of raising either range or amount affected by lowering the other factor an equal amount. For example, a Remarkable rank can Mold 3,000 pounds of material at a range of 8 areas. Either factor can be altered by as much as 5CS and produce results as varied as Feeble range (contact)/Shift X effect (15,000 lb.) to Shift X range (80 areas)/Feeble effect (200 lb.). The player has the further option of raising the Power rank +1CS by specializing in Molding a particular type of matter, such as wood, metal, stone, and so on. This option is not available if the hero also possesses any of the Elemental or Molecular Conversion or Creation Powers. The complexity of the intended design determines what Reason FEAT is needed. Simple, single-component designs require a green Reason FEAT. Complex or multiple-component designs require a yellow FEAT. Extremely complex designs (anything from a clock on up) requires a red FEAT and probably a set of blueprints. Exactly duplicating an existing object also requires a red Reason FEAT. The Power can function for as long as the hero can concentrate. Any failed rolls while attempting a FEAT mean that while the Power has begun to Mold the target, there is a problem because "something doesn\'s look quite right." Molding automatically affects any stationary, non-living, unprotected material. Moving targets require the hero to make an Agility FEAT to hit. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power in the same way they would try to Resist any Energy Attack. As mentioned earlier, living targets can be affected but not directly slain by this Power. A target can be protected from being Molded by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, certain Magics and Power Controls, temporary Conversion to a liquid or gaseous state, or an equal or higher rank of Molding. The simultaneous use of a protective Molding Power to counteract an offensive one by continually re-Molding the target into its original shape would look positively psychedelic as the target of both Molders continually rippled and wavered). The Power can be used quite profitably to outfit either heroes or villains with all the arcane and exotic equipment they need. After all, Quinjets, body armor, and nuclear pogo-sticks aren\'s exactly off-the-shelf purchases. Clever use of this Power could raise the hero\'s Resource level anywhere from +1CS to +4CS; the Judge and player will have to work this out for themselves.

Natural elements (Hydrogen to Uranium) require a green FEAT, artificial elements (Neptunium, Plutonium) require a yellow FEAT, and mythical elements (e.g., Vibranium) require a red FEAT. The hero can convert up to a number of pounds equal to their Power rank per turn. The amount of material converted weighs the same but may change in volume depending on the density of the element. The transformation is permanent unless the hero chooses a temporary effect, where the transformation lasts a number of turns equal to their Reason rank. If used on living tissue, the transformation is fatal, but temporary transformations result in Suspended Animation. The hero\'s sight limits the minimum amount of matter that can be transformed. Converting matter costs the hero 1 Health point per pound, which is regained after 24 hours. The Power can affect a maximum distance determined by the Power rank, and the hero can choose to modify the range or effect by adjusting the other factor.

The target can be electrified, starting with a static charge, followed by emitting electricity at -1CS Intensity, damaging itself if grounded. If continued, the target\'s molecular bonds break down, potentially leading to Disintegration (2CS). The hero can also create warmth by exciting atoms, acting as -2CS Heat, or make the target temporarily ethereal, allowing it to phase through solid matter, useful against Matter Conversion Powers. The range and duration of the Power are based on the hero\'s Power rank. The hero can affect a man-sized area, and larger masses will experience secondary effects. For example, the hero can ionize a specific section of a larger mass to disintegrate it while preventing electrocution. Ionization takes a number of turns equal to the Power rank, with the intensity increasing over time. The Nemesis Power is Energy Sponge.' },

However, it also directs Psionic or Sonic attacks towards the hero, making them -1CS to resist such attacks. The Power operates at the original volume level of the sound, with the ability to reduce loud sounds with a green FEAT and magnify faint sounds with a yellow FEAT. It is normally voluntary but can trigger automatically under certain conditions. Eavesdropping on another Clairaudient may alert them to the hero\'s presence.

However, Precognition is influenced by a malleable timestream, where each decision alters the future, creating parallel timelines. The Judge must prepare for this by creating a detailed timeline of the campaign\'s future events. In combat, Precognition can be used to predict the opponent\'s next move by making a yellow FEAT, giving the hero an advantage.

    { DieRoll: '76', Category: 'Psionic Vampirism', Description: 'she Psi-vampire can drain the mental energies of a victim to increase his own Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and Power ranks. The process involves a Power FEAT, with the intensity determined by the victim\'s Psyche. A successful FEAT drains an amount of energy equal to the Psi-vampire\'s Power rank from the victim\'s Reason, Intuition, and Mental Powers. The Psi-vampire can continue draining energy indefinitely unless they fail a FEAT, which results in repulsion and immunity from that victim. The drained energy is distributed among the Psi-vampire\'s Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and Powers, but cannot raise the rank of the Psi-vampirism Power itself. The Psi-vampire must feed regularly to prevent a drop in his Abilities, with each Ability losing one point per hour. If deprived of victims, the Psi-vampire enters a death-like trance, with his Abilities dropping to Shift 0 until he can feed again. Upon creation, the Psi-vampire must choose at least one Weakness, with the Power rank increasing +1CS for each additional Weakness chosen. Psi-vampirism is communicable; a victim completely drained by a Psi-vampire may become a Feeble Psi-vampire on a red Psyche FEAT. The Nemesis is an Enhanced Psyche raised two levels higher than the Psi-vampire\'s Power rank.' },

This is especially useful for sense-impaired characters who need others to compensate for their sensory deficiencies. The range for this Power is line-of-sight within one area, and the hero can scan for other potential sense-donors. Sensory Link can be used by non-sense-impaired heroes to spy, locate people, or explore areas through the senses of others. The sense-donor is unaware unless a red Reason FEAT is made. The Power reduces the hero\'s resistance to psionic attacks by -1CS and decreases their Agility and Fighting ranks by -1CS due to the detached viewpoint. These drawbacks can be mitigated by spending Karma. Optional Power: Telepathy. Nemesis: Neural Manipulation.' },

This Power can be used to analyze substances from a distance, detect hidden objects, or sense things otherwise undetectable, with a green Reason FEAT required for basic analysis. The range of the extended sense is determined by the Power rank. However, this Power also decreases resistance to Psionic attacks by -1CS.

The hero can control either a specific type of Power within an area or all Powers possessed by a specific being. The duration of control lasts a number of minutes equal to the Power rank number, and it must be reestablished after expiration. Control can be directed in a straight line or in an area effect.

The hero can force the victim to use his Powers in any manner the hero desires, but cannot alter the actual characteristics of the other\'s Power. The Macro-Power pits this Power\'s rank against the victim\'s Psyche. The Psyche determines what Intensity FEAT is required. The range at which the hero can exert Domination varies with his Power rank and the number of beings controlled. The range for Dominating a single being is shown on column A of the Range Table. Each additional being decreases the overall rank -1CS. The duration is as long as the hero can maintain concentration. If the victim fails his initial resistance, he can try again every ten turns with a Psyche FEAT based on the Power\'s rank. Normal, Power-less beings are unaffected by this Power. If the victim is cooperative, Domination is automatic. Domination can be thwarted by Powers such as Force Field vs. Mental Attack, Resistance to Mental Attack, and Power Control.

The hero can use his Macro Power to duplicate the characteristics of any other Power. The Power ranks for the duplicated Powers are equal to the Macro Power\'s own rank. Such Powers remain as long as the hero concentrates on maintaining their existence. Unfortunately, the hero can only duplicate a single Power at any one time. Switching Powers takes three turns. The hero must be exposed to a Power in order to later duplicate it. Such Powers must be used within 10 feet of the hero. A green FEAT enables the hero to store the Power for later duplication. It is assumed the hero has been exposed to others\' Powers at some point in his past. Initially, the character has a limited number of Powers he has already encountered; these are represented by Powers already generated but set aside. If this was the first Power the hero generated, then randomly generate a single Power. The hero rapidly gains Powers by duplicating those of companions or foes. Since the Power must be used, foes can be a hazardous source of new Powers. The hero has a finite number of Powers he can duplicate. The maximum number is equal to his Power rank number. If the hero exceeds the limit, the new Power replaces an old one. The act of analyzing a Power for later duplication takes three turns. In no way does this affect the source of the Power.

As long as the hero can maintain his link with this source, he can continue to use his Powers. The nature of the source and its link varies with each hero. If the source is small enough, the hero may be required to carry it with him. If not, perhaps the hero needs to periodically return to the source or forge an ethereal Power cord that links him to his Source despite any intervening distance. The Judge and player need to work together to produce a playable source and link. If the link is severed or the source destroyed, the Mage is left with a finite supply of energy left. The amount of raw Power left is the number of points equal to his Psyche rank. Each time he uses Power, he decreases the reservoir by that Power\'s rank number. Obviously, it is within the hero\'s best interests to renew his link or rebuild his source in as little time as possible.

The Macro-Power can store a maximum number of spells equal to this Power\'s rank number. The maximum number of total rank numbers is equal to this Power\'s rank number as well. The hero must be in contact with the target in order to fully charge it. If he does not make contact, the ranks for all spells to be bestowed drop -1CS for each ten feet separating hero and target. The act of creating an Energy Source can be disrupted by a variety of factors. The presence of a Psyche within the target prevents this Macro-Power from affecting it. Removing the target from range stops the process of creation. The Macro-Power can be blocked by such Powers as Force Field vs. Power Manipulation, Resistance to Power Manipulation, Power Control, and Power Domination.

Second, both players must randomly determine what the Gestalt-created Power actually is. Roll for additional Power; this is the Gestalt. The best example of Gestalt Power in the Marvel Universe was the Beaubier twins, Aurora and Northstar, who could generate Monstrous Intensity Light when they touched.' },
    { DieRoll: '56-60', Category: 'Nemesis', Description: 'When this Power is first generated, it replaces all other Powers the hero might have had. If a hero is clever, then no other Powers are needed. The basis for Nemesis is the ability to automatically analyze an opponent\'s Powers and Weakness. The hero then instantly generates a Power that can defeat the opponent. The newly created Power can be a +1CS version of the opponent\'s Power or an opposing Power. The nature of the Nemesis Powers varies with each opponent. The only Power that a Nemesis cannot generate is Power Control/Negation. Analyzing an opponent takes one turn. Designing a suitable Power and infusing it into the hero\'s body takes two turns. Switching opponents causes an additional delay of seven turns. The opponent must be within 10 feet of the hero for analysis to occur; this can be extended to 100 feet if the opponent is the only superbeing in the area. This Macro-power\'s rank determines the maximum Power rank of a generated Power. When facing a foe of greater strength, the player must select a Power that can still prevail, despite the disparity. Nemesis has two inherent weaknesses. The first is that the Macro-Power can only cope with a single opponent\'s Powers at one time. The second problem is that the Macro-Power is helpless against Powerless people. If there is no Power to overcome, then it cannot generate a Power. Because Nemesis possessing heroes tend to overly rely on their Macro-Power, they tend to be a little rusty when it comes to fighting normal people. Decrease Fighting\'s rank -2CS for such cases.' },

The transferral can be any combination of Powers and ranks. Only this Power cannot be transferred. Each transferred Power rank diminishes the hero\'s own rank for that Power. A single Power can be transferred each turn. The optimum range for Power Transferral is contact. Each ten feet that separates the hero and recipient decreases both the recipient\'s and hero\'s Power ranks -1CS. If the hero wants to simultaneously transfer Power to two or more recipients, he simply divides the ranks between them. The duration of the loan varies with the Reason rank of the hero and the FEAT made at the time of transferral. A green Reason FEAT gives a duration of 100 turns times the Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT changes the loan to a permanent grant. Most recipients tend to believe that suddenly receiving Power is in their best interest and thus the recipient cooperates in any way he can. Still, if the recipient wants to resist this Macro-Power, he can do so by moving out of range or blocking it by such Powers as Force Field vs. Power Manipulation, Resistance to Power Manipulation, and Power Control. Optional Powers include Mind Transferral and Magic Transferral. The Nemesis is Force Field vs. Power Manipulation.' },

The Power Vampire can force a nonliving, non-sentient target to release all its raw Power. He must make an Intensity FEAT equal to the highest ranked Power the target possesses. A drained item reverts to its original state. Living or sentient beings are harder to drain. The victim\'s Psyche determines what Intensity FEAT is required. A successful FEAT enables the Vampire to drain Power from the victim. The amount of raw Power equal to this Power\'s rank number is drawn in equal portions from all the victim\'s Powers. The process of feeding can continue indefinitely, as long as the vampire makes successful FEATs. Each turn drains another rank\'s worth of Power. The Vampire can voluntarily cease feeding at any time by making a Psyche FEAT of any color except red. A red FEAT means the hero has entered an uncontrollable feeding frenzy that can only stop when the victim is drained or the Vampire is repulsed. If the Vampire fails to make a FEAT at any point in the feeding process, he is immediately repulsed from the victim and can never resume the attack. The victim gains an instant immunity to any future Vampiric attacks by that being. The Power the Vampire absorbs is used to increase his own Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and Powers. The increase is in equal amounts to all the adjustable Abilities. The exception is this Power, as no Vampire can increase his own Vampiric Power. Power Vampires lose energy at a depressing rate. The rank numbers for Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and all Powers except this one decrease one point per hour. The Power Vampire must feed to survive. A Power Vampire cannot actually starve to death if denied a sufficient supply of victims. When all his affected Abilities reach Shift-0, the Vampire falls into a coma. His Power Vampirism continues to function and tries to drain anyone who comes within a foot of the body. When the Power Vampire\'s abilities return to Feeble rank, the Vampire returns to life. When creating a Power Vampire, the player must choose a Weakness. The player can raise his Power rank +1CS for each additional Weakness he chooses, up to a total of four Weaknesses. Power Vampirism is communicable. A living or sentient being who was completely drained by a Power Vampire must make a Psyche FEAT roll.

The player randomly generates the nature of the Weakness using the Tables in the early sections of this book. The duration of the Weakness is determined by a separate Reason FEAT made at the time the Weakness is created. A green FEAT gives a duration of 10 turns times the Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 1000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT further increases that to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number.

    { DieRoll: '03-09', Category: 'Alter Ego', Description: 'she hero has two different forms. One is a normal, powerless being; the other is the powerful, heroic self. When creating the hero, the player has to create two different beings. The statistics for the primary self should be fairly routine (all physical abilities ranging from Feeble to Good). All bets are off for the heroic self. Something many people never consider is that the heroic self might be a relatively normal human, while the normal self is something a little lower on the evolutionary ladder. For example, you might try a character whose normal self is a mutant dog (why should humans have all the deviant fun?). The two selves never co-exist except under extraordinary circumstances. Possible causes of simultaneous existence include time warps, cloning, and Lifeform Creation. The two selves may even be separated for an extended time, such as what happened to Bruce Banner and the Hulk. The primary drawback to this Power is the uncontrolled reversion to the normal self, especially when it occurs during dire circumstances. For example, Mightiman is rescuing a sub from the ocean floor when he reverts to his other self, little Eddy Edwards. (\"Can you say \'fish food?\' Sure you can.") Variations include automatic or voluntary transformation, duration, and shared minds versus semi-independent mentalities.' },
    { DieRoll: '10', Category: 'Anatomical Separation', Description: 'shis is the most grotesque Power available but it has its advantages nevertheless. With this Power the hero can spontaneously and harmlessly separate his body into independently functioning segments. Physiological functions like blood flow and neural activity continue in the same manner as if the body were whole. Detached parts cannot regenerate if the body is destroyed unless the hero has a regenerative Power. If any detached part is damaged or destroyed, the hero suffers the normal damage; his body also reassembles immediately, if possible. The practical basis for this is the power of Gateway/Spacewarp targeted on the hero\'s own body. In "game reality" the hero forms two parallel Spacewarps at the desired point of detachment, then shifts the location of the outer warp. The perceived result is that part of the hero\'s body detaches and flies off on its own. Normally, the majority of the hero\'s body acts as an anchor and cannot be moved by shifting the Spacewarps. The hero can develop Power stunts with which he can transport himself. (Example: the hero sends out a hand to grab onto a distant object and then pulls himself to it.) Detached segments can travel at Power rank speed for Land/Water movement; involuntary reattachment due to injury is instantaneous. The maximum range and duration of detachment are also based on the Power rank. Each additional detachment decreases the range and duration by -1CS, for a cumulative effect. If a single detached segment is prevented from returning to the body at the end of the duration, the rest of the hero\'s body is instantly drawn to the missing piece. Any intervening barrier is destroyed, doing damage to the hero appropriate to the barrier. If there are two or more missing parts, the rest of the hero\'s body is instantly drawn to a point midway between them. From there he can move freely in order to recover himself. He loses 1 point of Health for each 10 turns he remains apart. Upon reattaching the next-to-last part, he is instantly drawn to the last part. Separating the legs from the torso does not cause the hero to fall. Rather, the torso can move freely about on its own, at normal movement rates for Land/Water. Despite a player\'s misgivings, this Power lends itself to several useful Power stunts. A self-propelled swordarm is handy in a fight. A hero facing a toxic cloud could leave his nose behind. The Power provides +1CS protection against edged weapon attacks; a blade cannot sever something already detached. It is also a great Power for a macabre sense of humor. Due to the nature of this Power, the hero has a special vulnerability to attacks that disrupt his own Spacewarp. These include Gateway, Dimension Travel, any of the Teleportation forms, and any Power affecting Powers (+2CS for the attacker).' },

The hero\'s body does not significantly change; instead, existing flesh changes the way it functions. For instance, perhaps the lungs can now breathe water. The rank determines a successful duplication. Normal animals take a Typical Intensity FEAT, aliens a Good Intensity FEAT, and magical creatures need an Unearthly Intensity FEAT. Should the hero wish to duplicate an imaginary animal or being, he must make a Class 1000 Intensity FEAT. Duration ranges from one minute to indefinite.' },

Variables include speed and complexity of color change, and whether the Power is automatic or voluntary..' },
    { DieRoll: '21-27', Category: 'Body Adaptation', Description: 'shis is related to Life Support. The hero\'s body automatically adapts its physiology to enable it to survive in hostile environments. Unlike many of the other Powers that also permit this, Body Adaptation physically changes the hero\'s body. This Power involves automatically functioning versions of Body Transformation and Shapeshifting. The Power changes the hero into a form that has primary abilities proportional to the new environment. Example: An Adapting hero in a heavy-gravity world might now possess Monstrous Strength, but so do all the natives. Note: If the hero possesses a Strength rank greater than Typical, that CS is carried over into the new situation. In the above example, if the hero possessed Remarkable Strength on Earth, he possesses Shift Y Strength on the heavy world. The hero can completely adapt in one to ten turns, depending on the degree of difference between the new and home environments (Judge\'s discretion). The adaptation may provide the hero with new ways to move. On a water world, the hero might sprout fins. There is only one adaptation for each type of environment, and it is triggered automatically by the hero\'s entrance into the new environment. The Power cannot provide the hero with protection against hazards that suddenly occur; a prime example is the hero failing from a great height. This is a hazardous situation, but not a hazardous environment. When adaptation occurs, the hero gains the subconscious knowledge of how to use the new adaptations for survival. If not, we waste game time while the hero learns to breathe. At Shift X, the hero can consciously control the manner of adaptation.' },

Innate safeguards in this Power maintain the hero\'s lifeforce in any altered state. Altered states may not necessarily be mobile, or may move in new ways. (At FE and PR ranks, the hero is immobile.) Note: The safeguards that protect the hero might be disrupted or not included if another hero tries to duplicate this Power. In such cases, use of this Power may be instantly fatal! While in an altered state, the hero has a special vulnerability to attacks menacing that form. If the Absorbing Man transformed himself into paper while fighting the Human Torch… While in a solid altered state, the hero retains his overall normal appearance. If liquid or gaseous, he can assume any shape and still reform into his original appearance at the cessation of the Power. Normally, the hero must transform his entire body into the desired material. He can transform himself into multiple materials or transform specific parts of himself at a cost of -1CS.' },
    { DieRoll: '31-33', Category: 'Body Coating', Description: 'she hero can surround himself with a flexible layer of a protective substance not normally found on his body. The body coat provides protection and allows the hero\'s Power(s) to manifest (i.e., if the body coat is not present, the hero cannot use his other Powers). Damage to the body coating is not carried over to the hero\'s own Health; no points are lost even when the coating is completely destroyed. Any damage to the coating can be quickly repaired by the hero\'s body secreting more of the coating material. The degree of protection and the speed of repair to the coating are determined by the Power rank. The coating can be of any one substance. When creating the hero, the player must determine the nature of the Body Coating material. Common examples include ice, iron, steel, copper, rock, wood, and insulation. Each material has its own characteristics. If the player rolls this Power more than once when creating the hero, the player may opt for a variety of coatings or increase the rank of the first coating by +1CS, cumulative. When coated, the hero is vulnerable to attacks against that specific material, like flame against wood, electricity against metal, or sudden thermal change against rock. Variables include the material strength of the coating, its normal duration, the speed of creation, the rate of replenishment, and the effects on the body. The Body Coating Power gives the hero an added vulnerability to relevant Matter Control Powers. When the coating has reached its duration limit or is no longer needed, it simply flakes off the hero\'s body and quickly disperses as dust or vapor. If an opponent has the ability to negate the coating\'s flexibility (through Matter Control, Power Control, or Magic), the hero is paralyzed until he can remove the coating or until it reaches its duration.' },

The hero can transform his body into a resilient sphere, apparently transforming his body into a balloon-like caricature of himself. Heroes with this power are rarely taken seriously, but—despite the image problem—this power offers substantial benefits to the hero. While he is inflated, the bouncer can travel at power rank speed. His Fighting rank is increased by this power’s rank number. He has +3CS resistance to blunt physical attacks. On the down side, he also has a -2CS resistance to slashing attacks. In a given situation, the bouncer can maintain this power for the number of turns up to his power rank number before he has to deflate and rest. After 10 turns, he can then reinflate himself.' },

The hero can duplicate the chemical properties of any element or compound without his own body actually changing in composition. The hero\'s flesh simply acts as if it were the desired substance. Obviously the hero retains his solidity, even when duplicating the properties of a liquid or gas. Depending on the desired effect, the range of his chemical power varies from contact to one area. Tracking the hero by smell is difficult because his scent changes with each mimicry (-4CS to tracking ability).' },
    { DieRoll: '39-42', Category: 'Elongation', Description: 'shis is a specialized form of Shapeshifting. The hero can temporarily increase the length of any part of his body without losing leverage or strength. The hero can elongate any single part a maximum number of yards equal to his power rank number. If two or more parts are elongated, this limit is the total combined length for all parts concerned. The hand counts as part of the arm unless the hero is specifically elongating his fingers; in this case, the maximum is divided by the number of fingers elongated. For example, Mr. Fantastic is usually shown elongating an arm with a normal hand at the end of it; this gives him a greater reach than if he elongated his hand instead. The hero can maintain any single act of Elongation for a number of turns up to his power rank number. This power is primarily used by heroes like Mr. Fantastic to extend their reach or stride. Other heroes might also use the power to elongate body parts like the nose, ears, or eyes. This useful, albeit grotesque, tactic enables the hero to use his nose as a snorkel, his eyes as periscopes, and to eavesdrop on a room several floors away by sending his ear through the ceiling vent. The optional power is Plasticity.' },

The energy can be of any type (see the Energy Emission listings). When creating the character, the player determines the nature of the energy into which the hero can turn. The rank determines the number of possible energy types. The rank for each energy type is originally Good; this is modified by the Ability Modifier Table found on page 6 of the Player\'s Book. Each Power is rolled separately. Thus, a hero might have a Poor sound-form and an Incredible radiation-form. Damage to the Energy Body is the same as damage to the normal body. The Energy Body is subject to anything that would affect energy of its type. The hero makes a standard Resistance roll to determine such effects on the Energy Body. The hero may find himself confined in a storage field while in energy-form. If so, he must make a red FEAT to attempt to revert to normal. If he fails, he must escape in his energy form. The Energy Body is a relatively unlimited supply of that particular energy type. The hero can expend great amounts of it and still be able to return to normal. Completely depleting the Energy Body requires a red FEAT rolled by the Judge or an adversary. The hero can also absorb existing energy of his chosen type to replenish himself. This Power includes the relevant form of Energy Control and Emission for the purpose of controlling the energy within the body.' },
    { DieRoll: '45-49', Category: 'Energy Sheath', Description: 'she hero can surround himself with an energy field. This field provides protection, life support, and a means of manifesting the hero\'s other Powers. The energy field can be of any type (see the Energy Emission section for available types). Each energy field has its own characteristics that affect the ways the hero can use the Power. Only one Energy Sheath can be used at a time. The hero may possess several possible Energy Sheaths. The original rank for each is Good; this can be modified by the Ability Modifier Table on page 6 in the Player\'s Book. Each Power is rolled separately. Thus a hero might possess a Poor Sonic Sheath and an Incredible Vibration Sheath. Damage to the Sheath does not affect the hero\'s Health. If the Sheath is destroyed, the hero must make a red FEAT to regain it. Possible ways of destroying a Sheath include Energy Control and Conversion, Power Control, and Magic. When the hero is using this Power, he has a special vulnerability to Energy Control and Conversion Powers that can affect his type of Energy Sheath (-2CS). However, he also has +2CS Resistance to attacks using the same energy form as his Sheath. For the duration of the Sheath, it is assumed to be made of an infinite supply of that energy. (Otherwise, the character bookkeeping would be a nightmare. "Let\'s see, if I throw a fireball, that\'s gonna cost five minutes of power…") When creating the hero, the player can opt to replace one of the other Powers with a Transportation Power.

Note: This is "comic book" evolution, folks, the kind where superstrong cavemen eventually evolve into giant brains with vestigial limbs. If the hero possesses other Powers, the player may divide them among different evolutionary stages. For example, the caveman gets the physical Powers while the giant brain gets the mental ones. Rank determines the duration of the assumed stages. For the caveman, drop the Reason, Intuition, and Psyche, but raise the Fighting, Agility, Strength, and Endurance. For the giant brain, reverse the process and raise the Reason, Intuition, and Psyche. In both cases, the decreased abilities drop to Feeble, while the other abilities are raised a corresponding number of ranks. Divide the ranks as evenly as possible.

    { DieRoll: '56-57', Category: 'Growth', Description: 'shis is a self-directed form of MC6/Enlargement. The hero can temporarily increase his physical size at will. As he grows, the hero becomes an easier target. The bonuses to be hit, given in Table 3, are not cumulative. There are three ways the power can be attained: Atomic Dispersal, Atomic Gain, and Atomic Growth. The player randomly determines the method when he creates the character or when the character first gains this power, using the subtable below. Die roll | Form 01-25 | Atomic Dispersal 26-75 | Atomic Gain 76-00 | Atomic Growth With Atomic Dispersal, the hero increases the distance between his own atoms, thus increasing his overall size. His mass remains the same no matter how large he becomes. The hero also becomes increasingly fragile; his body’s material strength decreases -1CS with each doubling in size. At Shift X rank, the body becomes less dense than air. At CL1000 rank, the hero becomes intangible and can Phase through normal matter. Atomic Gain enables the hero to somehow create or gain new atoms and incorporate them into his atomic structure. As the hero gains new matter, his size and mass increase as well. As the hero grows, his strength increases +1CS for each +2CS of growth. The hero’s Primary and Secondary abilities are unaffected. However, Health seems to increase because physical attacks do less relative damage. Bullets, for example, would be nothing more than grains of high-velocity sand to a giant hero. Note that when the hero returns to his original size, wounds decrease in size—but imbedded bullets and other objects do not! Atomic Growth enables the hero to increase the size of his own atoms, thus increasing his overall size and mass. The hero’s strength increases only enough to enable him to move his own body; lifting strength does not increase. This form of Growth has a dangerous side effect. As the hero’s atoms grow, they are unable to interact with normal atoms. The hero is unable to breathe, drink, or eat normal matter. Fortunately, there is a 95% chance (determined at the time the hero is created) that the power envelops the hero’s body in a field that temporarily increases the size of consumed matter. Note that this is the only form of growth that will enable the hero to travel into macroverses or, if the hero is originally from a microverse, enable the hero to reach our own universe. The nemesis is MC4/Diminution; the specific nemeses for each form are, in order: Atomic Collapse, Atomic Reduction, and Atomic Shrinkage (see Shrinking). The following details to-hit bonuses against Growth-using characters: Resultant Rank | Size | Bonus to be hit FE | 1.5x | +1CS PR | 2x | +1CS X | 50x | +3CS Y | 100x | +3CS Z | 200x | +3CS CL1000 | 500x | +4CS CL3000 | 1000x | +5CS CL5000 | 10,000x | +6CS TY | 3x | +1CS GD | 4x | +1CS EX | 6x | +1CS RM | 8x | +2CS IN | 10x | +2CS AM | 12x | +2CS FN | 14x | +2CS SP | 16x | +3CS X | 50x | +3CS Y | 100x | +3CS Z | 200x | +3CS CL1000 | 500x | +4CS CL3000 | 1000x | +5CS CL5000 | 10,000x | +6CS MN | 18x | +3CS WN | 20x | +3CS UN | 25x | +3CS' },

There are four very different means of accomplishing this effect. Each form has unique characteristics regarding such factors as the area made invisible, protection against light-based attacks, mechanical detection, and detection by other means. Physics: This form makes the hero\'s body totally transparent to the visible light spectrum. He cannot be mechanically detected or recorded and is immune to attacks using visible light. At higher ranks, the invisibility range extends to cover other sections of the energy spectrum. Telepathic: The hero is visible but ignored and immediately forgotten by beings who would otherwise detect him. He can extend this invisibility to others in physical contact with him. Robots and cybernetic beings are unaffected. Hallucinatory: The hero is visible but surrounded by a telepathic field making others see an empty spot where the hero is. The hallucination can affect real-time viewers at a great distance but does not fool film or videotape. It provides protection against psionic attacks. Holographic: The hero is visible but has a holographic image of empty space surrounding him. The holograph affects anyone within line of sight but is mechanically detectable and recorded. It provides protection against light-based attacks. The duration of invisibility depends on the Power rank. Contact, physical attacks, or coatings (like rain or dust) can reduce or terminate the invisibility, especially for the Physics-based form. There is a base 2% chance that the invisibility is permanent, which can only be negated by nullifying the Power permanently.' },
    { DieRoll: '62', Category: 'Mass Decrease', Description: 'she hero can diminish his body’s mass. His weight decreases to a percentage equal to his power rank number. For example, the Vision’s Unearthly rank in this power decreases his weight by 100%, making him completely weightless. At Shift X and higher, the hero attains buoyancy and can lift additional weight. The added weight is a percentage of his normal body weight; for example, a 160 lb. man with Shift Z rank in this power can carry an additional 800 pounds (500% of 160 lbs.). When the hero is created, the player can increase the power’s rank +1CS by making its effect permanent. The optional power is Gravity Manipulation.' },
    { DieRoll: '63', Category: 'Mass Increase', Description: 'she hero can increase his body’s mass. His weight is multiplied by the power rank number. For example, a 98-pound weakling with Remarkable rank can increase his mass to 2,940 pounds (30 x 98). Fortunately, a side effect of this power increases the hero’s basic strength. No matter how much the hero weighs, he can still move as if he were his normal weight. Lifting strength remains the same. Of course, as the hero weighs more, he has a greater effect on the environment. At 2,940 pounds, our hero can fall through previously sound flooring or collapse the shocks on his 1973 VW Beetle. Physical force has a decreased effect on the hero because of his greater mass. In game terms, the power gives the hero power rank resistance to physical attacks. The hero can also use the power rank instead of his strength to inflict charging damage. Formerly weak characters can embarrass their adversaries with this new-found might. For example, the macho super-criminal Manbrute may flee into obscurity when Wimp-man simply sits on him with all 2,940 pounds, then delivers a stinging lecture on the benefits of niceness while the camera crews have a field day..' },
    { DieRoll: '64-67', Category: 'Phasing', Description: 'she hero can render his body intangible to normal matter. This enables him to pass harmlessly through any object. The hero’s power rank must exceed the barrier’s material strength in order for Phasing to occur. The hero can Phase through Force Fields, Body Armors, Resistances, and Invulnerabilities of lower ranks by making a green FEAT. Because the hero is out of phase with normal matter, he cannot breathe. Thus, the practical duration limit on this power is the length of time the hero can hold his breath. If the hero has some way around this problem, the duration is unlimited. Note that if the power is somehow “turned on” permanently, as happened to Kitty Pryde, the power gains the ability to transform air into phased particles that the hero can breathe. In the Marvel Universe, Phasing has a damaging effect on delicate electronic devices. By Phasing through such devices, the hero can disrupt normal activity and scramble any on-line programming. If, during the character creation process, the player decides to forego this side effect, he can raise his hero’s power rank +1CS. For modesty’s sake, it is assumed that the power also transforms the hero’s clothing and carried possessions into phased matter. The power’s side effect automatically scrambles any electronics the hero is carrying (Kitty Pryde wears a wind-up watch, never a digital one). If the player wants to risk his hero’s modesty for the sake of a more realistic game, the player can assume either that the power only transforms whatever the hero was wearing when he first got this power (severely limiting the hero’s wardrobe) or that there is a base 70% chance that the power automatically transforms whatever the hero is wearing at the time. In either case, this must be determined when the hero is first created.' },

Two or more relatively normal people actually merge their bodies to form a single, powerful being—the hero. When a player rolls this Power, he has to create three different characters. The Gestalt hero may physically resemble a blending of features from each of the merged characters, or have a completely different appearance. In any case, the Gestalt hero will have a normal appearance. No two-headed, split torsoed freak results, unless this Power is distorted in some way. Interference by such Powers as Magic or Power Control may result in the Gestalt hero forming as a freak. The hero can still revert to his normal selves, though, no matter how weird he gets (the Judge may want to require an Unearthly FEAT, though, at his discretion). Both or all normal selves are required to form the Gestalt. If one is unavailable, the Power cannot function. Damage to a normal self is carried over to the Gestalt self; for example, if one person has a whomping head cold, so will the Gestalt. However, the Gestalt hero\'s superior recuperative faculties can quickly repair any such illness. The normal and Gestalt selves never co-exist except under extraordinary circumstances (see S2/Alter Ego). The Gestalt mind may be a schizoid combination of each of the normal minds, or be a completely independent mind. In the latter case, the Gestalt may have full, partial, or no knowledge of his component selves. Likewise, the normal selves may not have any idea of what their Gestalt self is up to. Variables include whether the merger is voluntary or automatic, the duration, and the maximum difference between normal selves when attempting to merge. Normal distance is contact, but at high levels merges can occur across some distance; in these cases, the normals teleport to a common location (or perhaps one teleports to the other\'s location). Duration is determined by the Psyche of the Gestalt. Time varies from one minute to indefinite, with a median of 1048 hours.' },

The hero must state what plant power he is attempting. Players should also study up on their botany, since the more plants they know about, the more powers they can have.

If the hero wants to assume a shape that requires holes, he must make a red FEAT. For example, a higher-ranked hero could regularly transform himself into nets and ladders. The hero’s malleable flesh gives him power rank resistance to blunt Physical attacks.

The Power gives the hero\'s hair the capability of independent, controlled movement, as if each strand were a tiny tentacle, It is also a Power that apparently only women possess. The basis for this may be cultural rather than genetic (in the entire history of comic books, only three people had this Power—all women). Using her Prehensile Hair, the heroine can perform a variety of tasks with the hairs combining to form one or more appendages. She can handle objects, pick locks, ensnare a target, and even deliver a powerful blow with a silken fist. In a blunt combat the hair functions as one or more attacks. The maximum number of simultaneous actions and the Strength and Agility with which they can be accomplished are functions of the Power rank. Str./Agil. Rank # of Actions Adjustment Prehensile Hair possesses a sense of touch identical to that of the heroine\'s hands. Damage to the hair is felt. If you yanked out a lock of Medusa\'s hair, she\'d feel the same pain you\'d feel if she broke your finger (and you\'d deserve it). Loss of more than half the hair causes pain and damage equal to that caused by a limb lost by the same means; the heroine loses one-third of her Health (rounded down). The motivating Power for the hair is Telekinetic rather than muscular. The individual strands are identical to normal healthy hair. The coloration is often a brilliant red or golden blonde, but can be any color the player desires. The hair\'s length exceeds the normal limits; strands can reach a maximum length of 20 feet plus 5 more for each rank above Amazing. However long the hair is, when not in active use it contracts and does not extend past the heroine\'s knees. If the heroine\'s Power is nullified somehow, she retains her hair but can no longer feel or control it.

The new bodies are usually semi-independent; each possessing an independent mind but all are linked telepathically so all Duplicates are aware of each other\'s actions. Each Duplicate possesses the same Powers as the original, except for possible lacking this Power (that is, no Duplicate could generate more Duplicates). If a Duplicate is killed, the hero doesn\'s lose any Health, though he might lose Karma if the hero deliberately sent his Duplicate into a certain-death situation. If the original body is killed, the Duplicates will last until the duration of the Power is up-then disintegrate. If the hero\'s Duplicates possess an indefinite existence and the Power of Duplication, it matters not if the original body is destroyed. Thus, this Power offers a form of Immortality. Unfortunately, each Duplicate is the same physical age as the original, so this form of immortality doesn\'s turn back the clock at all. Sometimes this Power functions in a different manner, producing beings distinctly different from the original. Such semi-duplicates might possess altered minds, bodies, or Powers. For example, Shifter has the ability to generate independent beings who each possess a single, unique Power. Each time he uses his Power, he creates a new, albeit temporary, hero. At this rank, he has no real control over what Powers come out, but with extensive practice, someday he\'ll be able to custom-create his sub-heroes. In a case like Shifter\'s, each sub-hero gains a Power randomly generated at the time of his creation. Shifter has the potential to use any Power in this book. If he wants to try to make a conscious selection, his player must make a red FEATroll. If he blows it, the Judge rolls a Power for him. If the FEAT was yellow, the Judge rolls a Power in the same class of Powers as the player originally wanted; less than that, and the Judge can roll under any class he likes. All Duplicates possess statistics identical to those of the original hero.' },
    { DieRoll: '82-84', Category: 'self-Vegetation', Description: 'she hero can alter both his shape and physiology to become any desired plantform. The degree of change can vary wildly. At the least, the hero\'s body changes into a similarly-shaped "plantman;" at higher ranks the hero may assume normal or alien plant shapes. When in plant-form, the hero is immune to attacks that specifically affect animal life (nerve gas, pheromones, etc.) but is vulnerable to attacks that affect plant life (herbicides, light-blocking, etc.). When in plant form, the hero doesn\'s need to eat normal food; rather he uses photosynthesis to gain desired energy. This requires the availability of water, air, and sunlight. The plant-hero has different statistics for the physical Abilities; the mental Abilities remain unchanged.' },

Despite appearances, the hero retains his basic chemical composition unless other Powers are used simultaneously, such as S8/Body Transformation-Self. Example: Hobgoblin of the Shi\'ar Imperial Guard transforms himself into a stone wall. Despite its granite-like facade, it\'s composed of flesh; instead of chips flying when the wall is attacked, it bleeds. The hero can attempt to change into any form; success is determined by a FEAT. When creating the hero, the player can raise the Power rank by limiting the variety of possible forms into which the hero can change. Some categories include inanimates, machines, specific alien or animal races, superbeings only, and so on. Normal duration is determined by Power rank. If the hero attempts a shape that exceeds his normal size limits (i.e. not more than 150% nor less than 50% of his original size), this affects the duration, dropping it the equivalent of -3CS. This way a hero can attempt to impersonate a fly or a...' },
    { DieRoll: '91-94', Category: 'shrinking', Description: 'she hero can temporarily decrease his body’s size. The hero’s primary and secondary abilities remain unaffected. Even Strength is undiminished, although it is much harder for a shrunken hero to gain enough leverage to perform tasks that would otherwise be simple to perform. For example, consider the act of sharpening a pencil if you are only ladybug-size. As the hero shrinks, he becomes harder to hit but conversely suffers greater damage if struck. This is handled by the column shift as shown in the table below. The column shift decreases the attacker’s chance to hit and increases the damage by an equal shift. For example, a hero with Remarkable rank is-2CS to hit but suffers +2CS damage if the attack is successful. The following table details attack modifiers against Shrinking characters: Resultant Rank Size Column Shift FE 50% 0 PR 25% 0 TY 12.5% 0 GD 6.25% 1 EX 3% 1 RE 1% 2 IN .5% 2 AM .25% 2 MN .1% 3 UN .01% 3 X .001% 4 Y .00001% 5 Z .0000001% 6 CL1000 10 E-12 8 CL3000 10 E -18 10 CL5000 10 E -33 12 In practical terms, a Shrinking rank of Shift X, Y, or Z is sufficient to reduce a normal human to the size of a single cell or virus. Either CL1000 or CL3000 will reduce him to atomic scale. CL5000 reduces him to the point at which he can enter microverse worlds. On such worlds, the hero is proportional to his new environment. There are three forms of this power. When the power or the hero is first created, the player must determine which form is involved, using the following subtable. Die roll Form 01-20 Atomic Collapse 21-40 Atomic Reduction 41-00 Atomic Shrinkage Atomic Collapse decreases the distance between the body’s atoms and subatomic particles, thus decreasing overall size. Mass and strength are unaffected. As density increases, the hero’s body could collapse into neutronium (CL3000) or into a black hole (CL5000). Atomic Reduction decreases the number of atoms in the hero’s body. The lost atoms are either disintegrated (if the shrinkage is permanent) or temporarily removed from the hero’s plane of existence and stored “elsewhere” until the hero reverts to his original size. Both mass and strength decrease as the hero shrinks; these ranks remain proportional to the hero’s new size. If the hero loses too many atoms (by exceeding Shift X rank), his remaining structure becomes too simple to sustain his life force. For this reason, a hero with this form cannot voluntarily exceed Unearthly rank. If the limit is passed, the hero’s lifeforce is automatically stored away on the same plane with all the displaced matter that normally forms his body. At Shift Z rank, the hero’s body consists of a single DNA molecule, which then vanishes when the next rank is reached. Atomic Shrinkage reduces the size of the hero’s atoms, thus reducing overall size and mass. Strength remains proportional to the hero’s current size. This is the only form that enables the hero to reach a microverse. While this is the most popular form of Shrinking, it has a potentially deadly disadvantage. As the hero’s atoms shrink, they can no longer interact with other, normal-size atoms. As a result, the hero cannot breathe, drink, or eat normal-size matter. Fortunately, there is a flat 95% chance (determined at the time this power is first gained) that the power envelops the hero with an aura that temporarily reduces all atoms to be consumed. If the hero lacks this aura, he must have a proportionally sized supply of material for consumption or somehow not need to breathe. If not, the duration for this power is equal to the time the hero can hold his breath. There is an advantage to not possessing this aura in that electrons cannot flow from normal to shrunken matter; hence, the power acts as rank-level Resistance to Electricity. The optional power is MC4/Diminution. The nemesis is MC6/Enlargement; the specific forms are, in order, Atomic Dispersal, Atomic Gain, and Atomic Growth (see Enlargement).' },

The joining of these disparate beings generates the Power possessed by the Gestalt hero. The merging spirit can be of any nature, determined by the player at the time of the hero\'s creation. Possibilities include: Ancestral Gestalt: The merging beings are the hero\'s own ancestors. Spiritual Gestalt: The spirits are any Free Spirits. Demonic Gestalt: The merging being is a nasty supernatural type. Divine Gestalt: The merging spirit a bonafide divine being. Duration is determined by the Gestalt hero\'s Psyche.

    { DieRoll: '100', Category: 'swo-dimensionality', Description: 'she hero can harmlessly reduce his body (and any nonliving matter he carries) to a flat, two-dimensional version. To an onlooker, the hero appears to have transformed himself into a life-size photograph. The hero’s body functions and abilities are unaffected. Because the hero is now extremely thin, gaining leverage on three-dimensional objects is extremely difficult. He is also extremely hard to hit if he can turn his flat side toward his opponents. While in a flattened state, the hero suffers less damage from blunt physical attacks; the power rank number decreases the damage by that much for each attack. On the other hand, a flat hero can suffer all sorts of abuse that he would normally ignore. For example, Flatman could be forcibly folded like a map and locked in a glove compartment! How thin the hero can get is determined by an Intensity FEAT. A green FEAT reduces the hero to the width of a piece of paper (about 1/256”). At this point, the hero can pass through the cracks around a door or adhere to a wall and pretend to be a poster. A yellow FEAT reduces the hero to one atom’s width. At this width, the hero can pass through solid barriers by slicing through them as if he were an incredibly fine knife. The power enables the hero to pass any barrier with a Material Strength up to +5CS greater than this power’s rank. Note that if the barrier is larger than the hero’s body (such as a wall), then the slice made by the hero’s passage immediately reseals itself. But, if the barrier was smaller than the hero (such as a chain), then the pieces fall apart as soon as the hero severs the entire width. A red FEAT removes the third dimension entirely; at this point, the hero can pass through barriers without damaging them, or he can be transported into a Flatland-type dimension where everyone has only two dimensions. In the latter case, the hero vanishes from sight. The hero can choose to flatten himself in any direction. He can appear to be a front-back, left profile-right profile, top view-bottom view, or similar-shaped two-dimensional image. Note that while one dimension is drastically altered, the remaining measurements remain the same. When this power is applied to a weapon, the result is a micron-sword such as the one used by the late Nemesis. Such a blade completely severs any matter with a Material Strength up to +5CS greater than this power’s rank. The name “Two-Dimensionality” is a misnomer. While in the Marvel Universe it most commonly describes the ability of normal beings to pass into a Flatland-like state, it can also be used to shed more than one dimension. Three-dimensional beings can reduce themselves all the way down to a single line one atom or even one “point” in diameter. The power can also be used by multidimensional beings to enter into this one.' }

The physical body doesn\'s go anywhere; it remains in a comatose state until the astral body returns. The astral body is intangible and invisible to normal senses. In the Earth dimension it can use any of the hero\'s mental or Psionic Powers but not the physical ones. In other dimensions the astral body regains visibility, solidity, and the physical Powers. A magical silver cord connects the astral and physical bodies. While it can stretch a great distance, it is not infinite. The maximum distance the astral body can travel from the physical body is shown on the Space/Extradimensional Travel column of the Movement Table. The astral body travels at up to Power rank speed. This allows the hero to arrive instantaneously at a destination. The astral hero can cross into other dimensions by means of a Psyche FEAT. The silver cord links both bodies in several ways. It enables the astral to monitor the condition and location of the physical. Beings in the physical world can use that body\'s connection to locate the astral body. The silver cord is the key to the astral returning to its own body. If the cord is broken, return is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Once the cord is broken, the physical body begins to die. Health drops one point per hour. Fortunately, breaking the silver cord requires a CL1000 Intensity FEAT. If an attempt is made to damage the cord at any point, the astral body is immediately aware of the attempt and the location of the threatened length. If the physical body is killed, the cord is snapped automatically. The hero is now trapped in astral form as a Free Spirit. The astral body resembles the hero\'s self image. As such, it might not resemble the real body. All clothing and appurtenances the astral form carries are unreal simulations of the real items; they still have equivalent effects though. Astral bodies can be detected by Psionics, Magic, Extradimensional Detection, and by this Power.

The energy can be any type found in the hero\'s environment, such as magnetism, sound, light, heat, and electricity. The hero can use only one form; the player has to decide which one when he creates the hero. The Carrier Wave can support the hero and an additional load equal to its Power rank in terms of Strength. For example, Magneto\'s Remarkable rank enables him to tow up to a ton of material. The carrier wave is temporarily solid and visible. Flight occurs at Power rank speed. The maximum speed is that of normal energy of the type composing the wave. For example, a sonic carrier wave is limited to Shift-X speed. It is limited to areas where that energy exists. As the limits of that energy\'s domain are reached, it becomes weaker and finally fizzles out. The hero continues to move in a ballistic arc before he finally crashes. Carrier waves can be affected by the appropriate Energy Emission and Control Powers. Emission can change the speed or direction of the hero\'s travel. The Intensity of an opposing Energy Power decreases this Power\'s rank. A supporting Energy Power adds its Intensity to the Power rank. Example: Lodestone possesses Incredible Magnetic Manipulation. He tries to stop Magneto from flying away. Lodestone\'s Incredible rank decreases Magneto\'s Remarkable rank to -10.

The hero is transformed into energy and is propelled at Power rank speed along currents of that energy. The maximum speed is that normal Energy. The hero is limited to places where the energy currents flow. The player must choose what form of energy the hero turns into. Upon reaching the destination or the limit of the energy current, the hero safely rematerializes. Travel can be affected by anything that disrupts the current, such as a break in an electric line or the use of Energy Emission or Control Powers. When a disruption occurs, the hero must make a Power FEAT to detour around the obstacle and continue on. Failure means the hero rematerializes on the spot and can not reenter the energy path for an hour. The hero must be within 10 feet of the current in order to join it. Insulation of an Intensity exceeding his Power rank prevents the hero from joining the current. The hero can transform and tow along an additional mass. Treat the Power rank in terms of Strength to determine how much additional material can be transported by this Power. For example, a Typical rank can transport an additional 100-200 pounds. While in an energized state, the hero is extremely vulnerable to the energy altering Powers. These are Absorption Power, Energy Solidification, Energy Sponge, and Energy Vampirism. Any of these have the potential to trap or even destroy the hero. Fortunately the hero is moving at the speed normal for his energy type is thus a rather difficult target.

The disc can automatically support the hero and additional mass. The weight is supported by a Power FEAT with the Power substituting for Strength. For example, creating a Floating Disc to lift five tons is an Incredible Intensity FEAT. The disc\'s surface area expands to support wide loads. Travel occurs at Power rank speed. The Power provides no innate protection against high windspeed and friction burns, thus the practical speed limit for atmospheric Flight is Remarkable (225 mph). The Power can be used in the water with proportionally decreased speed. If the hero is a technological type or possesses such Powers as Hyper Intelligence, Hyper-inventiveness, Weapons Tinkering, or Mechanical Creation, then the Floating Discs can be mechanical in nature.

She can travel along a bridge from her current location to a location in space (a green FEAT), time (a yellow FEAT), and other dimensions (a red FEAT). The destination of each Gateway is a fixed point in space but the departure end always moves with the hero. A bridge to another location in space is created by a FEAT. A green FEAT creates a spatial bridge. The maximum distance the target can be from the hero at the time the bridge is created is shown on column E of the Range Table. A Gateway through time is created by a yellow FEAT. The maximum distance into the past or future the Power can initially reach is the number of centuries equal to the Power rank number. Gateways into other dimensions or alternate timelines require a red FEAT. The transdimensional bridges are initially limited to reaching only one dimension. Additional dimensions require development as Power Stunts. Once created, the bridge functions no matter how far the hero is in space, time, or the Multiverse. The hero has a finite number of locations she can bridge to. Once the hero has established the bridge, she always returns to it when creating that type of Gateway. The maximum number of different Gateways the hero can create is equal to the Power rank number. Shortly after gaining this Power, the hero should create at least half of her possible Gateways. More can be added at any time. If the hero exceeds her limit, a previously established bridge is replaced by the hero\'s trying to add. Example: Gatekeeper has Good rank. She can establish up to ten bridges. She establishes Gateways to her home, her team\'s headquarters at the Avengers Minnesota mansion, her ex-boyfriend\'s timesharing condo in Jamaica, the bottom of the Atlantic, geosynchronous orbit 22,400 miles above Minnesota, the crater of an active volcano in Iceland, the prisoner processing area of Ryker\'s Island Federal Prison, Tahiti in the year 1287, the surface of Lake Michigan (twenty miles east of Milwaukee), and Death Valley. The need arises for a bridge to an alternate Earth. Gatekeeper concentrates on establishing the link; making the red FEAT takes her most of the day. Later she realizes that she cant\'s hop over to Jamaica any more. Oh well, she hadn\'t been there with Wilford since he\'d gotten married. Gateways automatically transport willing passengers. The Power can be used to catch and transport unwilling passengers (like foes or rampaging water buffaloes) by means of an Agility FEAT. The would-be transportee is allowed to resist in any way he can. Gateways deal with size and not mass. The hero can transport a black hole as long as it\'s small enough. The maximum size of a Gateway is the number of square feet equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Feeble rank creates a two square foot Gateway that most people could just barely squeeze through. The Gateway forms within ten feet of the hero. It can maintain its existence for as long as the hero concentrates on it or until he passes through it.' },

In normal air currents, the hero drops one story (15 feet) for each turn she is in the air. Level flight can be maintained by an Agility FEAT; failure indicates a loss of 2 stories. The glider can climb by using updrafts. Using an updraft to climb requires a yellow Agility FEAT for each three stories the hero ascends; failure means she\'s caught in a downdraft and descends the three stories instead. She can carry aloft an additional mass; the limit is decided by her physical Strength. Gliding can be affected by high winds or the Powers of Weather Control and Air Animation. The wind\'s Intensity or the Power rank diminishes or increases the Gliding rank, depending on the direction the hero is gliding. For example, a Poor airspeed of 60 mph would be stopped by an equally fast headwind, but if the hero wants to travel in the other direction, she can be boosted to a Good airspeed of 120 mph.

Burrowing remains the hero\'s preferred mode of transportation, when compared to running or especially to inconceivable activities like flying. Normally the tunnel the hero makes collapses within 10 turns of the hero\'s passage at a specific spot. The exception is the tunnel within 10 feet of the hero\'s current location. This allows the hero to occasionally stop. A tunnel never collapses on the hero, unless a higher Intensity force is applied. Examples include explosives, Vibration, and Matter Animation. If the hero wants to build a relatively permanent tunnel, his movement rate is cut in half as he takes the time to make reinforced walls. The hero may burrow through materials with lower Material Strength than his Power rank. Materials with equal or greater Material Strength are obstacles to be detoured around. If the hero also possesses Hyper-Strength, Armor Skin, Body Resistance, or True Invulnerability, he can add such Powers\' rank numbers to this Power\'s rank number. This might permit the hero to burrow through harder materials, like granite intrusions or bank vaults, at half speed. When creating the hero, the player must choose a Bonus Power of either Natural Weaponry/Claws or Body Resistance. The rank of either is at least equal to this Power\'s rank.

(Otherwise, he might break a leg attempting even a Good leap.) The effect is the same on the hero as if he were a Normal Human making a 2-foot leap up or across or descending 3 feet. The effects on the area the hero lands on might not be the same as if a normal jump occurred. Consider that the Hulk splinters the pavement when he lands. To determine what sort of effects occur when the hero lands, the Judge should figure what kind of damage results when a weight five times that of the hero suddenly drops on the surface in question. The actual landspeed varies with the angle of the leaps. The average landspeed for Hyper-leaping is a -3CS Land Movement rate. For example, an Excellent Leaper can travel 30 mph in a series of rapid 30-foot leaps. If the hero also possesses Hyper-speed, that can be added to this Power\'s rank number for additional speed by increasing the frequency but not the size of the leaps. Physical burdens do not decrease the hero\'s speed, although they might decrease his control. Anything the hero is carrying is also protected by the innate safeguards against damage; the hero acts as a shock-absorber. While the hero has a vague idea of where he is going, he can\'s see his touchdown point. This can be a real hazard when the hero can make Monstrous leaps or better. For example, while leaping cross country, the Hulk landed on seven cars (two were moving at the time), one semi truck, eight roofs, a swimming pool, ten mud patches, one river, twelve power lines, three street lamps, 57 trees and bushes of various sizes, and a late Merino ram named Herbert. Judges can assume that the hero has enough control on his descent that he can swerve to avoid dangerous landing sites.

    { DieRoll: '35-42', Category: 'Hyper-Running', Description: 'she hero can run at Power rank speed for extended amounts of time. The Power has the side-effect of raising the Ability rank number of Endurance by this Power\'s rank number. It includes protection to wind resistance and windburn; this protection extends to anything the hero is carrying. The hero\'s lungs are modified to breathe high-velocity air. The last benefit can be crucial if the hero is capable of Remarkable speeds or better. If the hero stumbles, he continues on a ballistic trajectory until he regains his footing or rolls to a halt. To cut down on the chance of this, the Power increases the hero\'s reaction time to be able to cope with impending problems. The increased reaction time decreases the relative speed of any other moving object. The hero\'s Power rank number decreases the perceived speed of the other object. For example, Quicksilver\'s Shift X speed lets him perceive a bullet traveling at 600 mph as if it were traveling only 15 mph. This side-effect enables the hero to dodge or even catch things like bullets and missiles. If the Power is Duplicated or Transferred to another being, a special yellow FEAT must be made.

The Power does not free the hero from the need to breathe. The hero can tow other objects in his wake at a decreased speed of -1CS. This assumes the towed object has a buoyancy equal to the hero\'s body. If the object has a greater or lesser buoyancy, the hero\'s Strength determines the limit to what things can be towed. For example, Marlin has Typical Hyper-Swimming and Strength. He is trying to tow a sinking boat back to the harbor. While the boat is still floating, Marlin can swim at Poor speed (30 mph). Once the boat actually sinks, Marlin feels its full weight of 1000 pounds. Marlin is dragged to a halt, then the boat begins to pull him under.

The Skywalker can develop a Power Stunt that maintains the path even while he is unconscious. Another Power Stunt increases the path\'s tangibility to a circular area 10 feet around the hero; this enables others to travel alongside him. Note that the walkway only offers protection against failing. The path slides forward at its own speed. This enables the hero to travel at up to Power rank speed. When the hero rests, speed is reduced to zero. The path can be formed at any height but cannot climb on its own. Height is changed by the path forming a ramp that the hero climbs or descends.

    { DieRoll: '73-76', Category: 'seleport Others', Description: 'she hero can make any target except his own body vanish and instantly reappear at a distant site. The target does not physically cross the intervening distance and is unaffected by most physical barriers. Column E of the Range Table shows the maximum distance the hero can Teleport a passenger. Teleportation always occurs if the passenger is immobile or touching the hero. The passenger must make a yellow Endurance FEAT to see how he fared. Failure means disorientation for 1-10 turns. If the passenger is uncooperative or in motion, the hero must make an Agility FEAT to catch him. In addition, each 10 feet of distance separating the hero and passenger increases the Power rank -1CS. The Power can teleport a mass equal to the hero\'s Strength limit. This may be a single object or any number, so long as the weight limit isn\'s exceeded. If the hero is trying to exceed his limit, he only Teleports part of the mass. Living targets are transported intact; if a being weighs too much it simply won\'s Teleport. Only the amount of non-living material that is within the limit is Teleported; the rest is left behind. Example: The Teleportation beam aboard the spaceship Jenni Lea has Excellent rank and can handle up to 800 pounds of material. An emergency required the evacuation of five people (average weight 200 lbs.) and their equipment. The Teleportation beam sorted out its load before taking effect. Only four of the crewmen were teleported in the first turn. The fifth crewman, the equipment, and the clothes the other four had previously been wearing arrived on the next go-round. The hero can consciously try to Teleport sections of a target; the effect is as if the hero had used an extremely fine scalpel. Such Teleportational dissection requires a Power FEAT whose intensity is equal to the material strength of a nonliving target or the actual Strength of a living target. Heroes with Medical Talents can develop this type of exotic surgery as a Power Stunt. Certain conditions can prevent the passage of a Teleportation beam. Neutronium and black holes are impassable. Barriers that incorporate such Powers as Force Field vs. either Energy or Magic, Power Negation, or True Invulnerability are impenetrable if their Intensity ranks are greater than this Power\'s rank. The act of Teleportation takes three turns. The first turn the hero affects the target. The second turn the actual transportation occurs. The third turn the target rematerializes. Only on the fourth turn can the hero seek another target. Optional Powers include Teleport Self and Clairvoyance.' },

Column E of the Range Table shows the maximum distance the hero can travel. Upon attempting to form a new body, the hero must make a Power FEAT. A green FE' },
    { DieRoll: '79-80', Category: 'sime Travel', Description: 'she hero can travel in time to reach any point in the past or future. The maximum range the hero can reach is varies depending on which direction he\'s traveling. Travel into the past is easy because it already exists from the hero\'s point of view. The maximum range is equal to the Power rank number times 1000 years. Travel into the future is harder (at least, if you\'re planning a return trip). The maximum range into the future is equal to the Power rank number times 10 years. The act of time traveling takes 1-100 turns of the hero\'s perceived time. (No time actually passes but it sure feels like it.) The rate of perceived time passage varies with each mode of time travel but is consistent for all trips using that mode. For example, Dr. Doom\'s time platform makes virtually instantaneous trips while Kang\'s timeship travels at a rate of one year per turn. The theories behind Time travel vary on the flexibility of the past. Two theories stress the immutability of the timestream. The first theory states that all events are fixed; if you travel into the past, you are destined to perform those actions or some unknown force either prevents or negates your actions. (The Collector suddenly appears and stops Darkstar from assassinating a ten-year-old Abraham Lincoln.) The second theory states that the traveler actually travels to an alternate timeline that closely resembles the desired segment of the past. By changing this timeline, the hero cuts himself loose from his original timeline and is now linked to the one he has created. (Darkstar assassinates Lincoln. The U.S. breaks up during the Civil War and never becomes a world power. Darkstar emerges in a new present where the U.S.S.R.\'s chief rival is Anglo-American Codominion. Meanwhile on Earth-Marvel, the Avengers intercept a secret Soviet communique that deals with Darkstar\'s disappearance while on a mission.) The third theory states that there is only one timestream but it can be completely changed at any point when a traveler from the future alters a part of the past. (Alison Blaire of Her Majesty\'s Special Guard brings her superior, Lord Warren, Earl of Worthington, an intercepted Soviet report dealing with the appearance and subsequent elimination of a superhuman who called herself Darkstar.) Villains and well-meaning but misguided types tend to believe the third theory. This is a false belief since the structure of the Marvel Universe actually follows the second theory. Remember, people, that each Judge\'s campaign is set in a different divergent timeline. Judges are fully entitled to mangle the plans of any characters who intend to alter the timestream. After all, the players are going to create a lot of paperwork for the Judge if they succeed. By means of a Power Stunt, the hero can actually travel into the Time Continuum. This is a chaotic maelstrom of whirling lights and images that flash too quickly for the conscious mind to comprehend. Once within the Continuum, the hero can travel to any point in any timestream. Accuracy is nearly impossible. A green FEAT only gets the hero to the right timeline. A yellow FEAT gets the right century. A red FEAT gets the hero within the 10 weeks of the desired date. Since all time travelers must pass through the Time Continuum, it serves as a place where such travelers can attack each other. A traveler who is slain or rendered unable to return to normal time is lost forever. The Power can transport a mass whose weight is equal to the hero\'s Strength. If the Power is incorporated into a device, it can transport an amount equal to 100 pounds times the Power rank number. Time travel can be hindered and even stopped by the Power of Reality Alteration. A higher-ranked Power of this type can simply undo anything the traveler attempts or may even bar him from ever entering the timestream. Optional Powers include Dimension Travel, Precognition, Postcognition, and Reality Alteration. The Nemesis is Reality Alteration.' },

    { DieRoll: '83-93', Category: 'srue Flight', Description: 'she hero can fly through air and space without an apparent means of propulsion. This is the most desired Power in the history of the world. The Power rank determines the maximum speed the hero can attain in a specific condition. There are three mediums in which a hero can fly. The slowest form of Flight occurs when the hero torpedoes through the water at the Water Movement rate. Faster speed occurs when the hero flies through the air at the Air Movement rate. The fastest flight occurs when the hero is free of any hindering atmospheric friction; this is the Space Movement rate. Acceleration occurs at a rate of +1CS per turn. Deceleration occurs at -2CS per turn. The hero\'s maneuverability is determined by his Agility. The hero may be able to surpass light speed but if he has Feeble Agility he is going to need a wide turning radius. True Flight includes as a side effect Power rank resistance to atmospheric friction and lungs adapted to breathe high velocity wind. It does not include the ability to breathe water or survive the rigors of outer space. When creating the hero, the player can define the Power in any way that is consistent with the character or his equipment. Optional Powers include Body Resistance, Armor Skin, Self Sustenance, and Telekinesis. The Nemesis is Gravity Manipulation.' },
    { DieRoll: '94-97', Category: 'Water Walking', Description: 'EThe hero can temporarily solidify the surface of the water to enable him to walk on it without getting more than his feet wet. The pathway smoothes the water\'s surface to an average wave height and is not affected by waves of equal or less Intensity. The path slides along the water\'s surface. This permits the hero to travel at Power rank speed and the Water Movement rate. The Path only exists for the hero to use. It is intangible to others unless the hero can physically carry them or directly extend his Power to them. This can be done in two ways. One, when the hero is created, the player can decrease his Power rank -1CS by modifying the Power to extend 10\' around the hero. This area will support others, provided their combined weight does not exceed the hero\'s weight limit. The second method requires the use of another Power that can enable others to independently use the watery pathway; such Powers include Power Transferral and Creation. The Power normally functions only when the hero is consciously using it. The hero can develop a Power Stunt that enables him to maintain the path\'s solidity even when the hero is unconscious. The Power only affects water itself. It provides no protection against anything within the water. For example, a shark could rub the hero\'s soles as he walked. Water currents and high waves can slow, speed along, or redirect the hero\'s progress. High waves become the equivalent of self-propelled hills. Fast currents can change the hero\'s speed. Opposing currents decrease the hero\'s speed by the current\'s Intensity rank number. Supporting currents increase the hero\'s speed by the same amount. Waves and currents can be natural or created by such Powers as Matter Animation or Weather Control. The Nemesis is Matter Animation/Liquid.' },
    { DieRoll: '98-100', Category: 'Whirlwind', Description: 'she hero can fly by creating a small cyclone that carries him through the air. The hero can travel at Power rank speed but is limited to Shift-X rank. Maneuverability is determined by the hero\'s Agility. In addition to the hero\'s body, the Whirlwind can support additional weight. Each additional 500 pounds decreases the Whirlwind\'s speed -1CS. Passengers are not battered by the high winds but are safely held aloft by updrafts in the cyclone\'s interior. Still, all passengers must make an Endurance FEAT or become air sick. The Power provides rank level Resistance to Physical and Sonic attacks. High winds can affect the hero. Strong winds decrease the Power rank by their Intensity rank number. If the wind is powerful enough, the Whirlwind can be dispersed. Such winds can be natural or created by such Powers as Matter Animation or Weather Control. Optional Powers include Weather Control and Matter Animation/Air. These are also the Nemeses.' }
